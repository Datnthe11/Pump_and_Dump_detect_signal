    "title": "Bitcoin Risks Sliding to $118K as Dollar and Bonds Signal Caution to BTC; MOVE Supports Bull Case",
    "content": "This is an analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nThere’s very little reason to doubt bitcoin’s\nBTC\n$122,732.47\nupward trajectory right now. Although the rally has paused over the last 24 hours, the steep, near-90-degree uptrend line from lows just under $ 110,000 is still holding strong. In fact, prices tested that trendline early today and bounced right back, as shown in the hourly candlestick chart below.\n\nAnalysts suggest that those who missed the initial rally can consider using call spreads to capture further gains in a more risk-efficient way.\n\nA clean breakout above the expanding triangle’s upper boundary on the daily chart could clear the path toward the $135,000 to $140,000 range. The upper boundary acted as resistance on Monday.\n\nOn the other hand, if BTC falls below the hourly chart's ascending trendline, we could see a corrective phase, with the first support level around $118,000.\n\nLooking beyond BTC, traditional markets paint a picture where both bullish and corrective scenarios appear possible.\n\nBulls can take comfort from the MOVE index, which measures expected volatility in Treasury notes, continues to fall. The index dipped below 70 on Monday, its lowest since December 2021, signaling easier financial conditions for risk assets.\n\nHowever, the dollar index (DXY) and Treasury yields remain resilient despite the September rate cut and expectations of more easing ahead.\n\nThe DXY is flirting with a bullish double bottom pattern, while the 10-year Treasury yield has risen 16 basis points to 4.16% since the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points on Sept. 17. In other words, the yield has at least partially undone the rate cut.\n\nAdding to the mix, Goldman Sachs warned that Japan’s bond market shocks, driven by the new Prime Minister’s bias for Abenomics, could spill over into U.S. Treasuries and other major bond markets, injecting more uncertainty into the picture.\n\nTraders should keep a close eye on these indicators, as continued strength in the dollar and yields could disrupt crypto’s rally.\n\nEther\nETH\n$4,483.59\nhas risen 4% to form a bull flag breakout on the weekly chart. A bull flag is a counter-trend consolidation pattern that typically signals a continuation of the preceding upward move. Think of the flag as a pause where tired bulls regroup and gather strength for the next leg up.\n\nPerhaps, a strong rally above $5,000 could be on the horizon. That said, if we see a sell-off from here leading to losses by week’s end, it would be a clear signal that bears are taking control.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPEPE Falls 7% as Trading Volumes Surge and Memecoin Market Faces Broader Pullback\n\nThe sell-off was driven by significant activity in the crypto space, with whales taking profits and investors seeking cover from rising political risks.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "XRP is catching retail skepticism again in a gauge that has historically proven profitable for contrarian bets.\n\nData from Santiment shows the token’s bullish-to-bearish commentary ratio slipped under 1.0 twice in the past three days — October 4th (0.74) and October 6th (0.86) — levels that historically line up with fear-driven selling pressure.\n\nFor context, the last time retail sentiment was this negative was six months ago, around the announcement of Trump’s tariff plans. That episode preceded a bottoming setup, with prices later grinding higher even as commentary stayed cautious.\n\nSantiment frames the dynamic simply. When small traders lean too hard one way, markets tend to break the other.\n\nSeptember’s top offered the opposite lesson. On the 17th, bullish comments overwhelmed bearish ones by a ratio of 3.21 to 1 — marking euphoric levels that coincided with XRP topping out above $3.14 before sliding back.\n\nThe setup highlights the feedback loop between narrative and tape. A community that piles into optimism at highs often sets up a reversal, while a crowd leaning on despair while prices stabilize or inch higher tends to mark the start of another leg up.\n\nFor XRP, that means the current wall of FUD may be less a warning and more a tailwind — if demand steps in to prove the contrarian signal right.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPEPE Falls 7% as Trading Volumes Surge and Memecoin Market Faces Broader Pullback\n\nThe sell-off was driven by significant activity in the crypto space, with whales taking profits and investors seeking cover from rising political risks.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of S&P Global, plans to launch a new hybrid index that blends traditional equity markets with digital assets, offering a fresh option for investors looking to navigate the fast-changing crypto sector, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nThe S&P Digital Markets 50 Index will track 35 publicly traded companies involved in crypto infrastructure, blockchain applications and financial services, alongside 15 cryptocurrencies drawn from S&P’s existing Broad Digital Market Index. The result is a cross-asset benchmark that captures the performance of both the firms building the digital asset ecosystem and the tokens driving it.\n\nDinari, a platform that tokenizes U.S. public equities, collaborated on the index design and will issue a token, called a “dShare,” to let investors track the index directly on-chain. The token is designed to be transparent and accessible across blockchain platforms.\n\nThe move reflects a broader trend: institutional investors are increasingly treating digital assets as part of their core portfolios, not just speculative bets. “From North America to Europe to Asia, market participants are beginning to treat digital assets as part of their investment toolkit,” said Cameron Drinkwater, chief product & operations officer at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nIn practical terms, the index could appeal to investors who want exposure to crypto without going all-in on volatile tokens.\n\nCrypto stocks have surged in popularity this year as a wave of digital asset companies go public and U.S. regulators begin to provide clearer rules for the industry. Investors appear to be responding to both the improved regulatory outlook and the mainstreaming of crypto-related business models. Coinbase (COIN) has climbed 50% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Robinhood (HOOD), which has expanded its crypto offerings and acquired a crypto exchange earlier this year, has seen its stock rise more than 250% since January.\n\nDinari’s tokenization effort also represents a push to modernize how index investing works.\n\n“We’re not just tokenizing an index, we’re demonstrating how blockchain infrastructure can modernize trusted benchmarks,” said Anna Wroblewska, Dinari’s Chief Business Officer.\n\nThe Digital Markets 50 joins S&P's growing list of crypto-related indices and may signal a larger shift in how digital and traditional finance continue to merge.\n\nThe launch date has not been announced.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPEPE Falls 7% as Trading Volumes Surge and Memecoin Market Faces Broader Pullback\n\nThe sell-off was driven by significant activity in the crypto space, with whales taking profits and investors seeking cover from rising political risks.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "SEC Aiming to Formalize 'Innovation Exemption' by End of Year, Chair Atkins Says",
    "content": "NEW YORK — The Securities and Exchange Commission is still looking to formalize an \"innovation exemption\" for companies to build on digital assets and other innovative technologies in the U.S., potentially as soon as the end of the quarter, said agency Chair Paul Atkins.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the current government shutdown had \"hamstrung\" the SEC's ability to make progress on rulemaking, Atkins said working on this exemption is still his priority for the end of the year or the first quarter of 2026, he said at a Futures and Derivatives Law Report event hosted by the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday.\n\nThe SEC chair opened with one of his now-common refrains: That crypto is \"job one\" and the agency has become a pro-innovation body looking to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build in the U.S.\n\n\"As you know, we've had four years, at least, of repression of that industry, and with the result of pushing things abroad, rather than having innovation being done,\" Atkins said during a panel with former SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes.\n\nThe agency intends to initiate the rulemaking by the end of 2025 or during the first quarter of 2026, he said, depending on what happens with the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.\n\n\"We'll see where that goes, but I have confidence [we'll] be able to do it,\" he said on the panel.\n\nPursuing formal rulemaking in crypto would finally put the agency beyond the regulation-by-enforcement utilized in the previous administration or the informal guidance and staff notes so far used in this one.\n\nDuring a Q&A with reporters afterward, he said the exemption, which he pushed for last month, is something he was hoping to have \"squared away.\"\n\n\"That's one of the top priorities to try to get that because I want to be welcoming to innovators and have them feel like they can do something here in the United States, so that they don't have to flee to some foreign jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown is hampering the agency's work, Atkins said.\n\nWhile there are \"essential tasks\" that the agency can take on, rulemaking — including crypto rulemaking — is paused.\n\nAtkins praised Congress' work toward passing laws addressing cryptocurrencies during his panel, pointing to the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, though he noted that the SEC did not have a major role with that bill.\n\n\"Market structure is an issue there on the bill, and so we'll see where that goes,\" he said. \"I'm optimistic.\"\n\nSpeakers at a prior panel were less confident that a market structure bill will make its way out of Congress, at least before 2025 ends.\n\nSummer Mersinger, the CEO of industry lobbyist group Blockchain Association and a former commissioner at the Community Futures Trading Commission, said she gave the bill a 51% or 52% chance of passing this year.\n\nGreg Xethalis, a partner and general counsel at venture firm Multicoin Capital, said lawmakers should be appreciated for their work on the bill, while CoinFund's Chris Perkins said he did not believe the bill would happen.\n\nThe GENIUS Act, the first major crypto-focused bill to become law in the U.S., has started to yield preliminary results, with regulators at the Treasury Department publishing proposed rules for the stablecoin sector earlier this year.\n\nXethalis said much of what will happen next from a developer front is plumbing.\n\n\"Now that we have the rules at Treasury being written for the GENIUS Act, we're going to see a Cambrian explosion of people actually starting to utilize this stuff on a day-to-day basis,\" he said, pointing to Visa integrating USDC into their payment growth tooling as an example of how people might already be \"indirectly us[ing] crypto.\"\n\nSimilarly, Mersinger said stablecoin use could continue to grow, pointing to collateral in fund transfers and other types of financial contracts as a use case.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Meanwhile, the first regulated life insurance company that operates entirely in bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,732.47\n, said on Tuesday it has raised $82 million to scale its savings and retirement products that aim to protect against inflation and currency devaluation.\n\nThe funding round was co-led by Bain Capital Crypto and Haun Ventures, with participation from Pantera Capital, Apollo, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures and Stillmark, the firm shared in a press release with CoinDesk. The raise follows a $40 million round in April led by Fulgur Ventures and Framework, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was an early investor.\n\nFounded in Bermuda, Meanwhile offers life insurance and annuity products denominated in BTC, allowing policyholders to save and transfer wealth in an asset with a fixed supply. The service aims to guard customers against inflation and currency devaluation over time, but policyholders also take on bitcoin’s price volatility. Its products are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority and designed to mirror traditional long-term financial tools, but in BTC.\n\nThe company earns returns on held bitcoin through long-term lending to private credit markets, helping it meet claims obligations and maintain solvency standards similar to legacy insurers.\n\n\"Life insurers have always provided the steady, long-term capital that keeps financial markets moving,\" Zac Townsend, CEO of Meanwhile, said in a statement. \"We’re bringing that same role to Bitcoin — helping families save and protect wealth in BTC, while giving institutions new ways to earn returns and launch bitcoin-indexed products that are compliant and easy to scale.\"\n\nMeanwhile’s approach has found traction among both individuals and institutions, underscoring a surge in interest from customers seeking alternatives to dollar-based insurance and treasury products, the firm said. The company said its bitcoin assets under management has grown over 200% this year, outpacing bitcoin's 34% year-to date run to record highs.\n\n\"At Haun Ventures, our thesis is that the Bitcoin economy needs more than trading platforms and DATs — it needs the core building blocks of capital markets,\" said Chris Ahn, partner at Haun Ventures, in a statement. \"Just as the U.S. economy was built on insurance, pensions, and mortgages, the Bitcoin economy will require its own long-duration financial products.\"\n\nThe firm said the new capital will be used to partner with traditional insurers, grow internationally and develop new bitcoin-linked retirement tools that meet regulatory standards.\n\nMore For You\n\nYZi Labs Introduces $1B Fund for BNB Chain Projects\n\nYZI Labs says it wants the BNB ecosystem to form a backbone of \"democratized access and ownership\"\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin Dips to $122K as Crypto Rally Gets Overheated. What Next?",
    "content": "The crypto rally took a pause on Tuesday with bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,732.47\nquickly pulling back from record highs above $126,000 as analysts pointed to signs of crypto rally overheating, at least in the short run.\n\nBTC plunged below $122,000, erasing the past three days of gains and trading 2.4% lower in the 24 hours. The selloff rippled across the crypto market, with\nXRP\n$2.8793\n,\nDOGE\n$0.2527\n,\nADA\n$0.8246\nand\nAVAX\n$28.49\ndown 5%-7% during the period.\n\nIf the price action in bitcoin appears familiar, that's because it is. Despite a 31% gain year-to-date, bitcoin has given bulls very little chance to bask in their wins. Each record high has seemingly been met with a quick and viscous sell-off. Consider the first run to $109,000 just ahead of the Trump inauguration in January. That reversed lower to $100,000 in hours and to $75,000 within three months.\n\nJuly's first move above $123,000 was met with about a 10% decline over the following few days. And similar surge above $120,000 in mid-August presaged about a 15% plunge in ensuing days.\n\nThe declines this time around came after bitcoin's near-vertical 16% pump off the late September lows below $109,000.\n\nJean-David Péquignot, CCO of options marketplace Deribit, projected in a Monday report that BTC could revisit the $118,000-$120,000 zone shaking out traders who missed the lows and joined the rally late. If that pullback happens, he said, would offer a buying opportunity as technicals and the macro environment aligns for BTC to run higher above $130,000 through the last quarter of the year.\n\nDerivatives market and ETF inflows also got overheated, said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33. He noted that the past week marked the strongest BTC accumulation of the year, with a combined 63,083 BTC (worth roughly $.7 7billion) added across U.S. ETFs, CME and perpetual futures, surpassing the May peak. The surge was driven by widespread long positioning betting on higher prices without a clear macro catalyst, laying the ground for a pullback.\n\n\"Historically, similar bursts in exposure have often coincided with local tops, and the current setup suggests a temporarily overheated market with elevated risk of short-term consolidation,\" Lunde said.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran — a recent Trump appointee — said Tuesday his view of the neutral interest rate has shifted “from one end of the range to the other,” during a discussion at the Managed Funds Association Policy Outlook 2025. He now believes the neutral rate should stand at 0.5%. Miran pointed to tighter immigration restrictions and evolving expectations about the federal deficit as the main factors behind his reassessment.\n\nMiran’s comments suggest that long-term forces shaping the U.S. economy are changing. A smaller labor pool could limit growth, while rising fiscal pressures might keep the Fed’s balancing act between inflation and employment more complex. His remarks come as policymakers debate how much room the central bank has to cut rates without reigniting price pressures.\n\nFed officials meet at the end of this month to decide about a possible further rate cut, however, without critical data coming from the government as the shutdown continues.\n\nMiran also noted that economic growth in the first half of the year was weaker than anticipated, weighed down by uncertainty over trade and tax policy.

IREN and Cipher had the lowest power costs per bitcoin mined at roughly $29,000 and $31,200, while MARA’s (MARA) were the highest at about $56,200. On a fully loaded basis (power plus cash SG&A), IREN and CleanSpark (CLSK) led with costs near $54,000 and $60,000 per coin, compared with Riot’s (RIOT) $81,000. Bitcoin averaged around $98,500 in the quarter, leaving most operators profitable.\n\nJPMorgan said miners also accelerated fundraising, issuing about $590 million in new equity, up sharply from the first quarter, with much of it flowing to HPC projects. IREN raised $263 million to complete its 50-exahash expansion and begin building a 75MW liquid-cooled data center called Horizon 1. Total capex across the group reached about $900 million, below late-2024 peaks but rising sequentially.\n\nMiners collectively spent a record $2.1 billion on energy, the analysts estimated, while gross profits held steady at roughly $2.1 billion, with margins near 53%.\n\nThe bank said bitcoin’s strength and improving efficiency continued to offset network growth, sustaining profitability even amid escalating competition.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Miners' Market Cap Hit a Record in September: JPMorgan\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPEPE Falls 7% as Trading Volumes Surge and Memecoin Market Faces Broader Pullback\n\nThe sell-off was driven by significant activity in the crypto space, with whales taking profits and investors seeking cover from rising political risks.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nAs gold pushed through the $4,000 per ounce mark for the first time, bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,671.64\nlost 1.25% of its value and the wider crypto market, as measured by the coinDesk 20 (CD20) index, dropped 3%.\n\nThe drop came amid profit-taking after the crypto market rose more than 7.7% in less than a week and as whales’ paper gains swelled. The divergence also comes as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) rises to its highest level in two months.\n\nGold, long viewed as a safe haven, has rallied over 50% this year. Inflows into gold-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have accelerated, with holdings now at their highest levels since late 2022, according to ING.\n\nInvestors are seeking cover from rising political risk, including a new leadership crisis in France and growing tensions in Japan’s fiscal policy direction. Meanwhile, the U.S. government shutdown, now in its second week, has delayed key economic data and added to concerns about its fiscal outlook.\n\nBitcoin, while often considered as a hedge against uncertainty, has been hit by the rising U.S. dollar and short-term whales moving their BTC to exchanges, which suggests they’ve moved to lock in profit.\n\nAdding to bitcoin’s headwinds is the sharp rise in Japanese government bond yields, which jumped to a 17-year high this week. The 10-year yield touched 1.70%, pricing in the fiscal risks of incoming Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s Abenomics-inspired spending agenda.\n\nPer Goldman Sachs, pressure from Japanese bold yields could spill over into global bonds. Higher bond yields tend to tighten financial conditions globally and reduce investor appetite for riskier assets like BTC.\n\nStill, institutional interest in Bitcoin remains. U.S.-listed spot ETFs added over $3 billion in inflows last week, pushing total net inflows past $60 billion. This week, an additional $2 billion have been brought in, per SoSoValue.\n\nOther developments include S&P Global unveiled the Digital Markets 50 Index benchmark which tracks 15 cryptocurrencies and 35 crypto-linked equities, while the Intercontinental Exchange invested a $2 billion investment in crypto-native predictions market Polymarket.\n\n“In the near term, Bitcoin’s fundamental outlook remains positive, supported by monetary easing expectations, consistent ETF inflows, and persistent safe-haven demand,” Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, said in an emailed statement. “Should the Fed deliver clearer signals about the start of a rate-cut cycle in upcoming meetings, Bitcoin is likely to continue benefiting, with room to extend higher into new price territories in the fourth quarter.”\n\nThe next test could come from the Federal Reserve. Traders are pricing in rate cuts, and if the Fed confirms a shift toward easing, both gold and bitcoin could see renewed momentum.\n\nStay alert!\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's \"Crypto Week Ahead\".\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's \"Crypto Week Ahead\".\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's \"Crypto Week Ahead\".\n\nBy Oliver Knight\n\nCrypto Treasury Companies\n\nSpot BTC ETFs\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors\n\nMore For You\n\nBitcoin Rally is Fun, but Don't Overlook RWAs: Crypto Daybook Americas\n\nYour day-ahead look for Oct. 7, 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day.

    "title": "Survey Says: Crypto Voters May Skew Liberal But Favor What Trump's Done for Industry",
    "content": "President Donald Trump's approval rating has languished, but his relentless cheerleading for the crypto industry has won him a segment of loyal friends among U.S. voters: crypto investors who step outside their personal politics to praise his work and see the president and his Republican allies as the best bet for progress in digital assets.\n\nThe congressional midterms coming next year may continue to see a significant voting block up for grabs by candidates advocating for crypto-friendly policy, with 64% of investors in a new poll saying a candidate's crypto stance is important to them, according to answers from the 800 respondents in an online McLaughlin & Associates survey published on Wednesday. Polling in the previous elections in 2024 had already begun to demonstrate a growing segment of voters who considered crypto policy among their top concerns.\n\nIn this national snapshot, which was taken in late July under a commission from the Digital Chamber, an industry lobbying group, 73% supported Trump's crypto agenda and actions, with a 3.4% margin of error estimated. For this cohort of investors, the president carried a 54% approval rating — far above his level with the rest of the electorate.\n\nTrump's current, overall approval rating has slumped to about 40%, according to Gallup, which is a few points below former President Joe Biden's mark at the same period in that previous presidential term, though it's well above the 34% Trump ended his first term at.\n\nEspecially noteworthy about Trump's relatively glowing approval level from crypto voters is that the group otherwise tends slightly toward more Democratic and liberal views, their responses indicated. But a lot more of them trust Trump and the Republicans to elevate crypto causes (37%) than they do Democrats (24%), though \"neither\" came in at a significant third place (16%).\n\nThe surveyed investors were more likely to be registered to vote than the rest of the population, and they're more likely to be college-educated, male and earn a lower income, in addition to being generally younger and more racially diverse.\n\nUnder Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, the first major crypto law was established this year to govern stablecoin issuers. The industry's next priority is getting a bill finished that will regulate the wider U.S. crypto markets, though that effort may be languishing this year as lawmakers in Congress are bogged down in the budget fight that's shut down the federal government.\n\nThough Republicans have been stronger overall supporters of crypto measures, a wide swath of Democrats have joined in key votes to advance the policies.\n\nThe industry's massive political action committee, Fairshake, has already amassed a tower of funds to influence the outcome of next year's congressional races. The super PAC demonstrated in 2024 an interest in spreading the money between the two parties, though other prominent crypto insiders favor Republicans.\n\nRead More: Trump's New Crypto Enthusiasm Could Help Him Win More Votes: Poll\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin to $140K by Month End? Bullish Hopes Remain Even as Tuesday Drop Sends ETH, XRP, SOL Down 5%",
    "content": "Bitcoin is holding around $122,000 in Wednesday’s Asian hours after setting a record high at $126,200 earlier this week, with some market watchers still expecting a surge to a record $140,000 later this month.\n\nEconomist Timothy Peterson said in an X post Tuesday that bitcoin has a 50% probability of rising to $140,000, citing simulations that were based on data from the past decade.\n\n“There is a 50% chance Bitcoin finishes the month above $140k,” Peterson said in an X post on Wednesday. “But there is a 43% chance Bitcoin finishes below $136k.”\n\nBTC is up nearly 10% since the start of October, which has historically been one of the most bullish periods for all financial assets. The move has been driven by record ETF inflows and exodus of coins from centralized exchanges.\n\nExchange balances have dropped to a six-year low of 2.83 million BTC, with 170,000 coins withdrawn in the past month. That mix of steady institutional buying and shrinking supply has kept pullbacks shallow. The U.S-listed spot ETFs have added more than $60 billion since approvals in January 2204, including $3.2 billion last week, the second-largest weekly intake on record.\n\nTrading desks note that the path of least resistance is still higher as “Uptober” plays out. Besides, the outlook for S&P 500 remains constructive, supporting the bull case in BTC.\n\n“Options markets are pricing in a feral 5% chance for another 10% rally in the SPX into year-end, and it’s increasingly difficult to find a negative catalyst to counteract that view,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, said in a Telegram message. “We saw little short liquidation on the recent gap up, suggesting participants are underweight with minimal risk exposures.”\n\nStill, the optimism is not without risk.\n\n“The crypto market is navigating a delicate balance between strong technical support and significant macroeconomic uncertainty,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “Accumulation trends and institutional demand have propelled prices to new highs, but optimism is still exposed to surprises from the Fed.”\n\nThe absence of new economic data releases due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has depriving investors critical insights needed to make fresh allocations. Some observers are worried that lack of new data, particularly inflation, may keep the Fed from cutting rates.\n\nWhen FOMC and Mag-7 earnings arrive later this month, the data will collide with a market already extended and leaning bullish. That will decide if the next move is a clean run to $140,000 or a reset further lower.\n\nBTC's rally has paused in the past 24 hours, thanks to profit-taking. Prices have dropped more than 2%,, erasing a run-up since Sunday and pulling down XRP, Solana’s SOL, ether\nETH\n$4,479.06\nand Cardano’s ADA down as much as 7%.\n\nBNB Chain’s BNB stands out with 1.5% gains in the same period, the lone wolf in the green as its underlying ecosystem sees a flurry of fresh activity.\n\nMy lens: $125,000 is the battle line. ETF demand and whale withdrawals give the bulls a cushion, but the quiet from macro will not last.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPEPE Falls 7% as Trading Volumes Surge and Memecoin Market Faces Broader Pullback\n\nThe sell-off was driven by significant activity in the crypto space, with whales taking profits and investors seeking cover from rising political risks.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The Coindesk 20 Index has declined over 4% to 4,186 points.\n\nThe decline comes as the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's exchange rate against a basket of fiat currencies, rose to 98.90, the highest level since Aug. 5.\n\nStrength in the DXY typically weighs on USD-denominated assets, such as BTC and gold. BTC's price chart suggests scope for a deeper decline to $118,000.\n\nBTC hit record high over $126,000 early this week, as U.S.-listed spot ETFs pulled in over $3 billion in the week ended Friday.\n\nWhile BTC's rally has stalled, gold is showing no signs of slowing down, as its per-ounce price has surged past $4,000 for the first time in its history.\n\nAccording to ING, the recent rally is catalyzed by a surge in inflows into gold-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\n\"Investors are adding gold ETFs at a rapid pace. Last week, gold-backed exchange-traded funds expanded again, taking the total gold ETF holdings to the highest level since September 2022. There is still room for further additions, given the current total remains shy of the peak hit in 2020. More inflows could push gold even higher,\" ING's analysts said.\n\nPrices have doubled in two years, spurred by central banks buying the yellow metal to diversify away from the U.S. dollar.

    "content": "Bitcoin’s latest push through record levels has left short-term holder (STH) whales sitting on their fattest paper profits of the cycle of about $10.1 billion, according to CryptoQuant data.\n\nThese are entities holding more than 1,000 BTC that only entered the market in the past five months — the so-called “weak hands” of the cohort who usually fold first when volatility spikes.\n\nThe unrealized profit tally is the highest this cycle, a swing that reflects how quickly fortunes can change in bitcoin. Just weeks ago, late September’s dip left this same group underwater. Now, thanks to ETF inflows, a U.S. shutdown backdrop, and softer dollar conditions, they’re suddenly sitting on tens of billions in gains.\n\nBut that’s where the risk comes in as short-term whales aren’t famous for patience.\n\nA $10 billion profit pool is exactly the kind of setup that tempts some holders to take chips off the table, testing how much new demand really stands behind the rally.\n\nExchange inflow data already showed $5.7 billion moving from STH wallets into exchanges earlier this week, marking an early sign that profit-taking is not a theoretical risk, but an active one.\n\nZooming out, this cycle has already seen massive hand-offs between long-term holders (LTHs) and the shorter-term crowd.\n\nEarlier this week, analytics tool Checkonchain pointed out that 3.45 million BTC have shifted from LTH wallets to STHs since the cycle began — rivaling the 2016–17 transfer wave, only this time at prices roughly 100 times higher.\n\nWhether that distribution caps momentum or simply fuels the churn that keeps rallies alive depends on the bidding pressure in the coming weeks.\n\nFor now, that backdrop looks strong enough to soak up some profit-taking. But if STH whales hit the sell button en masse, $10.1 billion in unrealized gains could flip into realized pressure quickly.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPEPE Falls 7% as Trading Volumes Surge and Memecoin Market Faces Broader Pullback\n\nThe sell-off was driven by significant activity in the crypto space, with whales taking profits and investors seeking cover from rising political risks.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Fasset, a digital asset investment platform, has been given a provisional banking license in Malaysia, clearing the way for what it calls the world’s first stablecoin-powered Islamic digital bank.\n\nThe move places Fasset within a regulated sandbox for Islamic fintech, enabling the company to expand its existing digital asset platform into full-service banking, the company said in a press release on Tuesday.\n\nWith the new license, Fasset plans to offer Shariah-compliant savings, financing, and investment services that use stablecoins and tokenized assets. Customers will be able to hold deposits, invest in U.S. stocks, gold, and crypto, and spend through a planned Visa-linked crypto card.\n\nCEO Mohammad Raafi Hossain said the new license combines “the credibility of a global banking institution with the innovation of a fintech insurgent.” Fasset also plans to roll out “Own,” an Ethereum Layer 2 network built on Arbitrum, to settle regulated real-world assets on-chain.\n\nThe company said that its stablecoin infrastructure allows users to avoid interest-bearing products while preserving the value of their assets against inflation or currency swings. Shariah forbids all forms of interest (known as riba).\n\nFasset aims to address a persistent gap in financial inclusion across the $5 trillion global Islamic finance industry. Access to halal, asset-backed financial products remains limited in many Muslim-majority regions, especially in Asia and Africa.\n\nBack in March of last year, Fasset won a license to operate in Dubai as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), and the Dubai- and Jakarta-based company said its platform is already processing more than $6 billion in annualized transaction volume across 125 countries.\n\nMore For You\n\nYZi Labs Introduces $1B Fund for BNB Chain Projects\n\nYZI Labs says it wants the BNB ecosystem to form a backbone of \"democratized access and ownership\"\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Solana’s network continues to show unexpected resilience, according to new research from Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares.\n\nIn a blog post published Monday, Mena said Solana generated roughly $2.85 billion in annual revenue from October 2024 through September 2025, cementing its position as one of crypto’s fastest-growing blockchain economies. He described the revenue as “remarkably strong,” even as the speculative memecoin frenzy that drove early-year trading volumes has cooled.\n\nMena attributed Solana’s strength to its broad mix of activity. He said decentralized exchanges, trading tools, lending apps, wallets, and emerging sectors like DePIN and AI-driven applications all contributed meaningfully to network fees and usage.\n\nWhile trading tools such as Photon and Axiom led the way — collectively generating about $1.12 billion, or 39% of total revenue — Mena emphasized that Solana’s value now comes from its diversity rather than a single trend.\n\nEven after the peak months of late 2024, Mena noted that Solana’s monthly revenues have stabilized between $150 million and $250 million, suggesting sustained demand for blockspace and activity beyond speculative surges.\n\nHe compared the network’s total revenue to Palantir’s $2.8 billion and Robinhood’s $2.95 billion in 2024, saying Solana is “approaching the scale of major Web2 platforms.”\n\nMena also contrasted Solana’s position with Ethereum’s earlier stage of development.\n\nHe said that four to five years after launch — roughly where Solana is now — Ethereum averaged less than $10 million per month in revenue, highlighting how quickly Solana has monetized onchain usage. He credited the blockchain’s high throughput, low transaction fees, and growing ecosystem for accelerating adoption.\n\nAccording to Mena, Solana’s evolution reflects a shift from resilience to readiness.\n\nHe pointed to upcoming technical upgrades such as Firedancer and Alpenglow that aim to enhance speed and scalability, adding that these advances could position Solana for greater institutional participation.\n\n“Solana is no longer an experiment,” Mena wrote. “It’s a functioning digital economy showing real staying power.”\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPEPE Falls 7% as Trading Volumes Surge and Memecoin Market Faces Broader Pullback\n\nThe sell-off was driven by significant activity in the crypto space, with whales taking profits and investors seeking cover from rising political risks.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Gold futures just breached $4,000 an ounce, marking a gain of more than 50% so far in 2025.\n\nThe U.S. dollar, measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) which tracks the value of the dollar against a basket of major foreign currencies including the euro, yen, and pound has lost around 10% of its value this year and currently sits near 98.5.\n\nGriffin told Bloomberg, “We’re seeing substantial asset inflation away from the dollar as people are looking for ways to effectively de-dollarize, or de-risk their portfolios vis-à-vis U.S. sovereign risk.” Griffin added, “We’re definitely on a bit of a sugar high in the U.S. economy right now,”. U.S. equities are at all-time highs amid a boom in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.\n\nThe “debasement trade” narrative has resurfaced, referring to investors turning to hard assets such as gold, silver, and bitcoin as hedges against monetary debasement, a process in which excessive money creation reduces the purchasing power of a currency.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. government remains in a partial shutdown and rate cuts are widely expected. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are pricing in a 92% chance of a 25 basis point cut at the next meeting for Oct.29, which would lower the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75%–4.00%.

    "content": "The U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a $1.2 billion net inflow on Monday, marking the seventh occasion that inflows have exceeded $1 billion, according to Farside data. The majority of these inflows came from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted $970 million.\n\nHistorically, when inflows reach around $1 billion, it has often coincided with a short-term top in bitcoin’s price.\n\nThe first instance occurred on March 12, 2024, when bitcoin peaked at around $74,000 two days later on March 14. The next two instances were in November 2024, when bitcoin surged above $100,000, with large inflows appearing just before the rally concluded in December. On Jan. 17, another $1 billion inflow preceded a local top near $109,000 on Jan. 20. Similarly, on July 10 and 11, consecutive $1 billion inflows were followed by a short-term peak of $123,000 on July 14.\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin climbed above $126,000, so it remains to be seen whether a new high will form in the coming days, with bitcoin around $124,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable ETF, with assets under management just shy of $100 billion, generating an estimated $244.5 million in annual revenue. The next closest fund by revenue is the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF.

    "content": "A bump in fees on some of DeFi’s most-used applications is a sign of traders rotating back to fundamentally strong projects.\n\nSeptember revenues climbed to about $600 million, nearly double the $340 million low in March. Uniswap, the decentralized exchange that remains crypto’s largest trading venue, and Aave, the lending-and-borrowing protocol, drove much of that rebound. Synthetic-dollar project Ethena joined them among the top earners, according to The Block Research.\n\nWhat’s different now is how protocols are trying to make token design matter again and are actively routing value back to holders.\n\nOn Uniswap, governance earlier this year approved $165 million in new foundation funding this year while explicitly laying the groundwork for the long-debated “fee switch” — a mechanism that would direct a portion of trading revenue to UNI holders once v4 rolls out on Unichain.\n\nAave has gone in another direction. DAO service providers put forward a framework that routes surplus revenue into regular buybacks and the ecosystem reserve, replacing one-off treasury tweaks with a standing accrual policy.\n\nThe aim is to recycle earnings into AAVE and tighten the link between usage and token performance. That mechanism has already been activated as fee growth picked up this year.\n\nEthena’s model is more straightforward. Its USDe and sUSDe system turned fees into yield, distributing them directly to holders as total value locked expanded.\n\nDashboards now place Ethena among the top generators of distributable revenue across DeFi, a position reinforced by integrations with Aave and yield trading application Pendle that funnel more activity into its stablecoin engine.\n\nThe tokens of these projects have performed in line with market trends but haven’t outperformed so far, but traders may want to keep an eye on Uniswap’s UNI, Aave’s AAVE and Ethena’s ENA\n\nWhile these are not equities, the underlying fundamentals and fee jumps gives trading desks a framework to value them beyond vitality alone.\n\nQuestions about staying power remain, however.

    "title": "FOMOing into Bitcoin? Check Out These Bullish BTC Plays Favored by Analysts",
    "content": "With bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,661.29\nkicking off the seasonally bullish October on a strong note, rising to record highs above $126,000, traders who missed the early rally might be feeling the urge to jump in.\n\nIf that latecomer’s FOMO, or fear of missing out, has struck, here are some bullish BTC option plays favored by analysts that might be worth considering to ride the wave smartly.\n\nMarkus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, prefers buying higher strike out-of-the-money (OTM) calls or call spreads.\n\n\"Buying 1–2 month out-of-the-money (OTM) calls or call spreads (for example, $130,000/$145,000) allows traders to participate in further upside without overpaying for implied volatility,\" Thielen said in a note to clients Monday.\n\nA call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.\n\nA bull call spread is an options strategy where you buy a call option at a lower strike price and simultaneously sell another call option at a higher strike price, both with the same expiration date, similar to the $130,000/$140,000 spread suggested by Thielen.\n\nSelling the higher strike call limits your potential profit but also reduces the upfront cost of entering the trade. More importantly, this strategy limits your maximum loss to the net premium paid on the spread in the event the market unexpectedly falls, making it an ideal play for traders seeking to balance potential gains with limited risk.\n\nWhile BTC is expected to rally into the year-end, the probability of a sudden correction, triggered by profit-taking, cannot be ruled out entirely.\n\nInterestingly, traders are booking call spreads via block trades, Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk.\n\nFlows are dominated by large blocks of call spreads, either very long-dated (Sep 2026) or very short-dated, likely monthly ones,\" Chen said. \"On the other hand, obviously, we do see a lot of profit taking as well.\"\n\nAnother way to gain bullish exposure while minimizing initial cost is to finance the bull calls spreads by writing (selling) lower strike OTM put options, according to Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata.\n\n\"Selling the OTM put and using the proceeds to buy multiple call spreads, instead of an outright OTM call, can help minimize the term structure vol expense, still capture upside,\" Magadini said.\n\nHowever, it’s essential to understand the risks associated with this strategy. Selling put options obligates you to buy BTC at the put's strike price if the market falls below that level, which exposes you to potentially significant downside risk if BTC's price drops sharply.\n\nWhile the bull call spread limits losses from the call side to the net premium paid, the short put leg introduces additional downside exposure that can be much larger than the initial credit received.\n\nBroadly speaking, BTC calls, especially those with longer durations, are cheaper compared to put options, according to Magadini.\n\nLastly, for those looking for long-term exposure, simply buying and holding BTC has historically been the most rewarding strategy. Since 2011, BTC's price has skyrocketed from $1 to over $120,000.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$122,661.29\nremains in an uptrend, despite the overnight pullback. The world's largest cryptocurrency is on fire, having rallied nearly 10% in one week.\n\nWhile the buzz around BTC is natural, other sub-sectors, such as real-world assets (RWAs), are lighting up big time and deserve attention.\n\nOn Monday, Ondo Finance, one of the top five RWA projects by market value, announced the acquisition of Oasis Pro, a U.S. firm with full SEC broker-dealer, ATS, and Transfer Agent licenses.\n\nThe takeover enables Ondo to offer compliant tokenized securities products in the U.S., including the issuance, trading, and management of tokenized assets such as equities, corporate debt, and structured products. The ONDO token rose nearly 5% to 96 cents, while continuing to trade well below its December 2024 peak of $2.14.\n\nIn a parallel development, the RWA-focused Layer 2 blockchain, Plume Network, said that it has been registered by the SEC as a transfer agent.\n\nThe license allows Plume to manage digital securities and shareholder records directly onchain, supporting interoperability with the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) settlement network. The network's native token (PLUME) rose by 25% to over 12 cents on the announcement.\n\nTaken together, these announcements signal that the digitization and tokenization of traditional assets are gaining regulated traction, bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation.\n\nIn other news, Cathie Wood’s ARK Venture Fund invested about $10 million in Securitize, a BlackRock-backed tokenization firm. The stake makes it ARK’s eighth-largest holding.\n\nSpeaking of the market outlook, the path of least resistance for BTC remains on the higher side, supported by ETF inflows. However, there is an interesting point to consider: Each of the previous times ETFs pulled in $1 billion or more in a day or two, bitcoin's price put in an interim top and subsequently corrected lower, according to CoinDesk analyst James Straten.\n\nAdditionally, the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, remains resilient despite discussions of faster Fed rate cuts against the backdrop of the U.S. government shutdown.\n\nA potential rally in the greenback could weigh on cryptocurrencies and gold. The latter is fast closing on the $4,000 mark, a rally that has likes of Citadel concerned.

    "title": "Bitcoin Breaks $126K, What For XRP, ETH, ADA as Shutdown Fears Keep Bulls in Control",
    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$111,480.33\nrose to $126,223 on Monday, marking another record as the U.S. shutdown, softer dollar, and surging ETF inflows converged to tighten supply and extend the rally.\n\nAs of writing, the cryptocurrency traded near $124,000, building on a 15% weekly gain that has pulled majors higher across the board.\n\nElsewhere, bitcoin has broken records in euro and Swiss franc terms, crossing EUR 106,000 and CHF 99,600, as well in Japan. The Asian nation's new prime minister is signaling a return to Abenomics-style easing, which plays directly into the market’s narrative of easier liquidity conditions ahead, as CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole noted on Monday.\n\nThe broader market picked up a bid, following bitcoin's lead. Ether surged 4% to $4,700, its highest in three weeks, with traders eyeing the $4,800–$5,000 range if momentum holds.\n\nBNB continues to be the outlier, up more than 20% in the past week and setting fresh records above $1,240, a move that highlights rotation into ecosystem names when the base asset has a bid. Dogecoin gained 6% to $0.26, XRP ticked higher to nearly $3, and Solana has added over 12% in the past seven days.\n\nThe breadth of this rally is noteworthy. The total crypto market capitalization rose to $4.27 trillion before easing slightly to $4.24 trillion. The sentiment index stands at 71 (greed), close to levels last seen in August but still short of euphoria. That leaves room for extension without the signs of a blow-off top.\n\nBTC's move to record highs wasn’t a leverage-led spike. Weekly spot ETF inflows crossed $3.2 billion, the highest since November 2024 and second-largest on record, pushing total allocations since January to more than $60 billion, according to data source SoSoValue.\n\nThis ETF-driven demand is echoed by some analysts.\n\n“Bitcoin’s climb above $124,000, fueled by $3.2 billion in spot ETF inflows, underscores deepening institutional conviction and a maturing market narrative,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, in a note to CoinDesk.\n\nMeanwhile, FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich warned that long-term holders have been active sellers around these levels since July, meaning supply is waiting if demand falters.\n\nBTC's exchange balances have fallen to a six-year low of 2.83 million BTC, with 170,000 withdrawn in the past month, signaling coins moving off exchanges and into longer-term storage. It’s that combination of steady ETF buying and shrinking supply that seemingly underpins this move.\n\nThe U.S. government shutdown is entering its second week, stalling key economic releases and creating uncertainty about fiscal direction as investors seek clarity on growth.\n\nSimilar shutdowns have historically nudged capital toward hard assets, such as gold and bitcoin, reflecting concerns about political stability and its impact on fiat or equity markets.\n\nIn 2013, BTC nearly doubled through October as Washington gridlock persisted, while gold added more than 3% during the same period. The 2018–19 closure was different — bitcoin slipped about 10% over five weeks while gold barely moved. The latest record high suggests that the market is following the 2013 pattern.\n\nAt the same time, the dollar has softened, removing a headwind for dollar-denominated assets, and bond markets are starting to price a more cautious Federal Reserve.\n\nTraders increasingly expect that a combination of weaker data prints and fiscal paralysis will prompt policymakers to tread carefully on rates or at least avoid further tightening.\n\nFor bitcoin, that reads as easier liquidity conditions ahead, with the kind of dovish bias that has historically accompanied major upside runs in the overall market.\n\nAs a neutral observer, $125,000 looks to be a magnet and now a battle line.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPEPE Falls 7% as Trading Volumes Surge and Memecoin Market Faces Broader Pullback\n\nThe sell-off was driven by significant activity in the crypto space, with whales taking profits and investors seeking cover from rising political risks.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain and widely used for transaction fee discounts on Binance, jumped more than 5% over the last 24-hour period, crossing the $1,280 mark to hit a new all-time high.\n\nThe rally comes as traders digested signs of increased demand from institutions and surging activity on the underlying blockchain, driven in part by the newly launched decentralized exchange Aster.\n\nBNB Chain reported a record 58 million monthly active addresses, overtaking Solana’s 38,3 million according to data from TokenTerminal. The growth reflects rising usage that’s closely linked to Aster, which saw its total value locked jump over 500% to $2.4 billion, according to DeFiLlama.\n\nThe price move also coincides with the announcement of a partnership between BNB Chain and Chainlink to bring official U.S. economic data on-chain.\n\nDuring the peak of the rally, trading volumes exceeded the 24-hour average for a single session. That level of activity suggests there’s broader strength behind the rally.\n\nBNB’s recent move builds on broader optimism across crypto markets, though the cryptocurrency has been outperforming the wider market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, which is up just 0.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe wider market has been rallying amid a U.S. government shutdown that has left the Federal Reserve with data delays.

    "content": "Decentralized AI skill market Recall Network announced on Wednesday that it will debut its native token, RECALL, on Oct. 15, with select early supporters receiving airdrop access.\n\nThe ERC-20 token will be generated on Coinbase's Layer 2 network Base and can be bridged to other blockchain networks, Recall said in a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk.\n\nThis release is supported by a coalition of leading AI-focused partners, including Eliza, Sapien, Gaia, Cookie, Olas, Morpheus, Intuition, Protocol Labs, and Lit, all sharing a vision of accelerating global progress through decentralized AI ecosystems.\n\nToken holders will utilize RECALL to crowdfund AI tools and solutions tailored to their specific needs. Developers creating successful AI agents and models, as well as individuals who help select the best ones, will earn RECALL tokens.\n\nThis will ensure that only the best AI products get rewarded and top the platform's leaderboards. Token holders can also vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nBy enabling token holders to fund, rank, and reward AI tools tailored to their specific needs, Recall is shifting AI development away from closed, centralized systems toward an open market where the best AI gets incentivized.\n\n\"Skill markets accelerate the development of quality AI towards the diverse needs of humanity by giving people the power to crowdfund AI tools for the use cases they need and earn by ranking the best submissions,” Andrew Hill, CEO of Recall Labs, said.\n\n“Whether you need crypto trading bots or python coding tools, for the first time, you now have a say in what AI gets built, and the incentives to ensure only the best AI gets rewarded,\" Hill added.\n\nRecall, a result of the merger between Textile and Ceramic development company 3Box Labs, decentralized platform designed to create a network for AI agents to store, share, and trade knowledge on the blockchain. It represents a decentralized marketplace where AI models (or agents) can compete, showcase their specific skills, and be evaluated transparently on a blockchain. Recall launched its public testnet in March 2025.\n\nAt the time of the launch, 200 million RECALL tokens will be made available for use, representing 20% of the total supply of 1 billion tokens.\n\nOut of these initial tokens, the largest portion – 30% – will be dedicated to supporting the community and growing the ecosystem. These tokens can be used to fund user rewards, platform development, grants, and strategic partnerships, thereby enhancing adoption.\n\nAn additional 27% of tokens will be unlocked after the first year, with the remaining 73% scheduled for a gradual release over the subsequent 48 months.\n\n\"We’re proud to reward early supporters and launch with a world-class list of partners who share our vision for accelerating human and AI alignment and bringing attention to AI solutions that actually work,” Michael Sena, CMO of Recall Labs, said.\n\nWhen the mainnet goes live, Recall will start with markets already set up for crypto trading AI agents, enabling users to monetize their knowledge about how well these agents perform.

The tokens, available to institutional and accredited investors, allow for onchain subscription, redemption and reporting.\n\nThe Sei Network, built for high-speed financial transactions, provides the underlying rails for execution. KAIO's expansion follows ARK-backed tokenization firm Securitize introducing the $112 million Apollo Diversified Credit Fund, a tokenized feeder fund of Apollo's private credit vehicle, to Sei.\n\nThe announcement highlights a growing trend in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), where traditional investments like bonds, credit and funds are represented as digital tokens. The process promises faster settlements, around-the-clock trading and potential to integrate with smart contracts and plug into decentralized finance (DeFi). Industry estimates project the total addressable market for tokenized RWAs in the trillions of dollars.\n\nWith KAIO's integration with Sei, starting with tokens representing shares in the BlackRock ICS US Dollar Liquidity Fund and Brevan Howard Master Fund, will let investors use tokens within DeFi applications as collateral, liquidity reserves or yield-bearing assets, offering more flexibility in how institutional capital moves onchain.\n\nJustin Barlow, executive director of the Sei Development Foundation, framed Kaio's expansion as a key milestone for Sei toward its ambition to \"become the institutional settlement layer for all digital assets.\"\n\n\"By using the Sei Network, we’re bringing composable access to leading fund strategies entirely onchain,\" Olivier Dang, COO of KAIO, said in a statement. \"It’s the foundation for real-time, programmable, financial infrastructure built for the next era of capital markets.\"\n\nRead more: 'Tokenization Is Going to Eat the Entire Financial System' Says Robinhood CEO\n\nMore For You\n\nRWA Chain Plume Acquiring Dinero to Expand Institutional DeFi Yield Offering\n\nThe deal aims to boost Plume's institutional push offering a broader set of yield strategies including liquid staking, co-founder Teddy Pornprinya said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Asia Morning Briefing: Singapore Authorities Say Token2049 Organizer Not Covered by Russia Sanctions After A7A5 Appearance",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nA7A5’s appearance at the recent Token2049 conference wasn’t in contravention of Singaporean law, despite being backed by a sanctioned Russian bank, highlighting the limits of the city-state’s sanctions regime, which applies only to licensed financial firms.\n\nA7A5's ruble-based stablecoin is backed by Russia’s state-owned Promsvyazbank (PSB), an entity sanctioned by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as well as financial authorities in the U.S., U.K., and most Western jurisdictions. Bloomberg recently reported that the E.U., as a bloc, is considering sanctions against A7A5 too.\n\nIndeed, an audit prepared for Old Vector LLC, the parent company behind A7A5, warns of possible \"redemption and regulatory issues\" regarding use of the tokens considering the breadth of the sanctions.\n\nGiven A7A5 was a sponsor at Token2049, complete with booths and branded massage rooms, one has to wonder if this contravened Singaporean rules given the exchange of funds.\n\nThe answer, according to MAS, is no.\n\n\"Singapore financial institutions (FI) are not permitted to facilitate transactions (whether directly or indirectly) for designated persons in contravention of our financial measures,\" a MAS Spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. \"An entity that is not an FI regulated by the MAS is not subject to the financial measures.\"\n\nUnder Singapore’s sanctions framework, financial measures targeting Russia’s Promsvyazbank and related entities bind banks, insurers, capital-markets intermediaries, and digital payment token providers.\n\nBut, according to MAS' own guidance, non-financial companies and individuals are only obligated to comply with United Nations-mandated sanctions, which have never been applied to Russia as the country would veto them as a member of the U.N. security council.\n\nFurthermore, Token2049 is organized by Hong Kong registered BOB Group. Hong Kong, as part of China, does not have any financial sanctions on Russia which makes recieving funds from A7A5 legal in the territory.\n\nSingapore's sanctions are a bit different from what's been imposed in the U.S. where the company behind A7A5 is Specially Designated National (SDN) under U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) meaning U.S. persons are prohibited from interacting with them in any way.\n\nIt may seem like an edge case, but Foundation for Global Political Exchange v. U.S. Treasury shows just how far those restrictions can go.\n\nOFAC initially denied the Foundation for Global Political Exchange, a U.S. nonprofit, permission to host members of Hezbollah – understandably sanctioned individuals – at a forum they organized in Beiruit about peace in the middle east, ruling that simply offering a platform or audience constituted a prohibited service under U.S. sanctions law. Only after a first amendment challenge did OFAC reverse its position, narrowly allowing participation under strict conditions: no payments, no lodging, no coordination, and no affiliation with the event’s host.\n\nBy that standard, even in the U.S., hosting A7A5 could be legal if no money or material support changed hands. In Singapore, where sanctions bind financial institutions but not conference organizers, it’s an even easier call. Washington regulates who you can pay; Singapore regulates who can move the money.\n\nSomewhere between those two philosophies – and one Hong Kong crypto wallet – A7A5 found a perfectly legal booth and massage room.\n\nBTC: Bitcoin fell to around $122,000, down 3% from record highs, as analysts warned the crypto rally had become overheated following the year’s largest ETF inflows and leveraged positioning, with Deribit projecting a possible pullback to $118,000–$120,000 before another run toward $130,000\n\nETH: Ethereum is trading around $4,479, down 4.4%, as traders lock in profits following recent gains and rotate out of ETH into other assets, pressuring prices after a strong rally.\n\nGold: Gold surged past $4,000 for the first time as investors flocked to safe havens amid a weaker dollar, Fed rate cuts, and geopolitical uncertainty, with central banks and retail buyers driving demand; Goldman Sachs lifted its 2026 forecast to $4,900, though Bank of America warned the rally may be overextended.\n\nNikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Wednesday, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 hovered around 48,120 — buoyed by optimism over pro-growth policies under new LDP leadership and a tech-fueled global rally, even as concerns about stimulus durability and valuation risks linger.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "U.S. Blacklists Crypto Network Behind Ruble-Backed Stablecoin and Shuttered Exchange Garantex",
    "content": "The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Thursday sanctioned a network of companies, exchanges and executives linked to shuttered Russian crypto exchange Garantex and the ruble-backed stablecoin A7A5, accusing them of helping Moscow skirt international sanctions.\n\nGarantex, founded in 2019 and once licensed in Estonia, processed more than $100 million in transactions linked to ransomware and darknet activity, OFAC said. U.S. officials, working with German and Finnish police, seized its web domain and froze $26 million in March, which quickly prompted the creation of its successor Grinex to continue operations, officials said.\n\nOFAC said on Thursday that Grinex transferred customer funds from Garantex and used the A7A5 token to restore access after the seizures. Issued by Kyrgyzstan-based firm Old Vector, A7A5 was created for Russian users of A7 LLC, a cross-border settlement platform, the agency said.\n\nIt is backed by Russia’s state-owned Promsvyazbank (PSB), who was sanctioned for financing the defense industry, and Moldovan politician Ilan Shor, who was convicted in a $1 billion bank fraud case, the Centre of Information Resilience reported.\n\nOFAC sanctioned Old Vector, A7 LLC and its subsidiaries A71 and A7 Agent, blocking them from the U.S. dollar-based financial system and barring U.S. persons from interacting with any of these entities or more than a dozen crypto addresses tied to them.\n\nKey Garantex executives Sergey Mendeleev, Aleksandr Mira Serda and Pavel Karavatsky were also sanctioned, along with Mendeleev’s firms InDeFi Bank and Exved, accused of enabling sanctioned Russian businesses to trade through crypto rails.\n\nTreasury officials said the action, coordinated with the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, was aimed to cut off digital asset channels used for ransomware and sanctions evasion.\n\n\"Exploiting cryptocurrency exchanges to launder money and facilitate ransomware attacks not only threatens our national security, but also tarnishes the reputations of legitimate virtual asset service providers,\" said John K. Hurley, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, in a statement.\n\nA7A5 has grown rapidly this year, processing about $1 billion a day by July, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic's report. The firm said the token underpins a \"sanctions evasion scheme\" enabling Russian companies to settle cross-border payments outside the traditional banking system.\n\nChainalysis estimated the token’s cumulative transaction volume exceeded $51 billion through July, warning it offers \"a new, crypto-native avenue to bypass the ever-tightening sanctions against Russia.\"\n\n\"The emergence of the A7A5 network sanctioned today further illustrates how Russia is operationalizing these alternative payment rails,\" the firm said.\n\nRead more: Tether, Tron-Backed T3 Financial Crime Unit Has Frozen $250M of Criminal Assets in a Year\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The move was driven by a surge in institutional flows — over 1.5B tokens transacted — and whale disposals exceeding $300M.\n\nMacro catalysts dominated sentiment. Markets now price a 96% chance of a Fed rate cut on Oct. 29, while 70+ ETF applications, including seven for XRP, face SEC deadlines starting Oct. 19.\n\nResistance remains entrenched at $3.04–$3.05, where heavy selling capped the advance. Support is validated at $2.99, reinforced by multiple retests and absorption of intraday liquidation flows. The price structure suggests accumulation at the $2.99 base, with a potential bullish continuation if momentum can retake $3.03 and challenge $3.05.

    "title": "Figure Gets Mixed Wall Street Debut as KBW, BofA Diverge on Outlook",
    "content": "Two major Wall Street investment banks have issued differing views on the newly public fintech firm Figure (FIGR), as the company works to expand its blockchain-based lending and capital markets platform beyond home equity lines of credit.\n\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) initiated coverage of Figure with an “outperform” rating and a 12-month price target of $48.50, suggesting 17.5% upside. The bank praised Figure’s early dominance in tokenized credit markets, where it holds 73% of the private credit segment and 39% of all tokenized real-world assets, according to KBW’s estimates.\n\nFounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, Figure went public in September and has climbed 12% since its IPO. Its core business tokenizes HELOCs and connects borrowers to investors through a vertically integrated platform that includes loan origination, distribution and a digital asset marketplace.\n\nKBW sees Figure’s tech stack as underutilized and capable of supporting a wider range of credit assets, such as first-lien mortgages and personal loans. It also pointed to upside from products like Figure Exchange and a tokenization tool for third-party assets.\n\nAnother broker, Bernstein, earlier initiated coverage on the stock with a more upbeat outlook. It rates Figure as an \"outperform\" with $54 price target, citing that the firm is doing for lending what stablecoins did for payments, tokenizing traditional assets to make markets faster and more efficient.\n\nRead more: Figure Is a Blockchain Pioneer in Credit Markets, Says Bernstein, Initiating at Outperform\n\nBank of America, however, took a more cautious view.\n\nIt initiated coverage with a “neutral” rating and a $41 price target, citing risks around execution, regulation and Figure’s dependence on its HELOC business, which still generates most of its profits and is not yet fully blockchain-native.\n\nBofA sees Figure Connect — a new marketplace that helps lenders match with capital providers — as the company’s next growth driver. The bank expects it to account for 75% of the firm’s total revenue growth between 2024 and 2027.\n\nWhile both banks acknowledged Figure’s leadership in a neglected corner of consumer lending, they diverged on how easily the company can scale into a broader fintech platform. BofA cited possible roadblocks onboarding large institutions, competition from other tech providers and changing regulatory rules, including updates to the Truth in Lending Act.\n\nThe difference in price targets — $48.50 from KBW versus $41 from BofA — reflects the uncertainty surrounding whether Figure’s blockchain infrastructure can transition from a niche use to a more central role in modern finance.\n\nRead more: Blockchain-Based Lender Figure Prices IPO at $25 Per Share, Raising Nearly $788M\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Global banks and asset managers are exploring tokenization to cut settlement times, broaden investor access and keep markets open around the clock.\n\nIt's potentially a huge opportunity: the tokenized asset market has grown 112% to $33 billion year-to-date, RWA.xyz data shows, and could swell to $18.9 trillion by 2033, Ripple and BCG projected earlier this year.\n\n\"ARK Invest’s strategic investment reflects growing conviction among leading institutional investors that tokenization will fundamentally transform capital markets,\" Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said on Tuesday in a statement announcing ARK's investment in his firm.\n\nSecuritize, founded in 2017, is one of the early pioneers of the tokenization space. It issued $4.6 billion in tokenized assets working with traditional finance giants such as BlackRock, Hamilton Lane and Apollo. It is also known as the issuer behind BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) that's leading the tokenized U.S. Treasury sector with $2.8 billion in assets.\n\nThe firm is also active in equity tokenization, creating on-chain shares of listed wallet provider Exodus in 2022 and entering into an agreement with ether\nETH\n$4,485.43\ntreasury firm FG Nexus (FGNX) to introduce its common and preferred stock to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nARK's investment follows Securitize's $47 million fundraising round last year, led by BlackRock and Hamilton Lane (HLNE), with ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets (TW) also participating.\n\nUPDATE (Oct. 7, 13:00 UTC): Adds statement from official announcement.\n\nMore For You\n\nBrevan Howard-Backed Tokenization Firm Expands Funds to Sei as RWA Momentum Grows\n\nTokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are emerging as a key bridge between TradFi and DeFi.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Plume Network, a modular Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), is now an SEC-regulated transfer agent, streamlining the issuance, transfer, and management of tokenized securities.\n\nThe network's native token (PLUME) rose by 25% following the announcement as daily trading volume rose by 186%, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAs a registered transfer agent, Plume will now manage digital securities and shareholder records directly onchain, supporting interoperability with the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) settlement network, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nFurther, it will facilitate a range of use cases, including onchain IPOs, small-cap fundraising, and registered funds. Most notably, the technology aims to reduce tokenization timelines from months to mere weeks via smart-contract automation.\n\nPlume's registration provides a much-needed regulatory infrastructure for institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and Apollo seeking compliant on-chain asset transfers.\n\n\"At Plume, we believe transfer agent regulation exists to protect investors’ rights as shareholders. With this fully onchain transfer agent protocol, we are streamlining the issuance of digital securities with a built-in partnership with regulators,” said Chris Yin, CEO and Co-Founder of Plume.\n\n\"The crypto industry has been searching for a viable bridge between DeFi’s speed and TradFi’s safeguards. With the issuance of this license places Plume as the ideal solution for this search,\" Yin added.\n\nA transfer agent in the traditional sense is a financial institution that maintains official records of a company's shareholders, manages ownership changes, issues stock certificates, and handles dividend and interest payments.\n\nA blockchain transfer agent, such as Plume, performs similar functions on-chain by leveraging distributed ledger technology, offering a secure, immutable and transparent digital record of asset ownership and transfers.\n\nPlume’s achievement comes after its active collaboration with regulatory bodies, including its contributions to discussions surrounding the GENIUS Act. The announcement follows SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s remarks last week expressing the regulator’s openness to engaging with issuers of real-world asset tokenization projects.\n\nPlume's regulated transfer agent is operational, which allows interested funds to engage with Plume’s infrastructure with immediate effect, even as broader regulatory frameworks continue to evolve.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, Plume plans to launch its initial product offerings, involving Nest protocol vaults, in the first quarter of 2026. Within Plume Network, Nest is one of the significant protocols focused on staking mechanisms for real-world asset (RWA) protocols.\n\nNest allows fund managers to create vaults backed by regulated financial instruments. Users can then deposit stablecoins into these vaults to earn yield in a permissionless way from the underlying real-world assets.\n\nPlume said that it has already garnered interest from SEC-registered investment funds (40 Act funds). And while regulatory challenges, such as asset custody issues, present hurdles, the company anticipates these will diminish as the SEC proposes new rules through 2026 and finalizes them by 2027.\n\nThe 40 Act funds are publicly offered, pooled investment vehicles, such as open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts, registered under the Investment Act of 1940.\n\nThe timing aligns with a broader market shift toward onchain securities and positions Plume at the forefront of this transition.\n\n\"The license enables Plume to support the migration of offchain securities into compliant digital forms, especially 40 Act funds—the traditional backbone of the U.S. asset management industry representing over $39 trillion,\" the firm told CoinDesk.\n\nPlume is also seeking additional licenses, including Alternative Trading System (ATS) and broker-dealer registrations, to develop a fully compliant onchain capital market infrastructure for 40 ACT funds.\n\nUPDATE, Oct. 6, 15:22 UTC: Changes headline and adds paragraph to include token move.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Zac Prince, the former chief executive and co-founder of collapsed crypto lender BlockFi Inc., is back in the digital asset industry as the head of Galaxy Digital’s new banking platform, Galaxy One. The move marks Prince’s return to a leadership role less than three years after BlockFi’s bankruptcy, which followed the implosion of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nGalaxy hired Prince earlier this year to oversee Galaxy One, which launched today and allows users to earn yield on cash deposits and trade both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities. The appointment places Prince at the center of another effort to merge crypto services with mainstream finance but this time, under markedly different conditions.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Prince said his personal risk appetite is “more conservative” after what he experienced with BlockFi. He described Galaxy as “night and day in terms of the differences in the setup and the risk appetite and the regulatory structures of the businesses.”\n\nBlockFi became a symbol of crypto’s lending boom and bust. The company drew users by offering interest accounts with returns as high as 9.5%, before collapsing when FTX’s failure left it short of liquidity. In its early days, the company raised funding from the top investment firms, including Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures as well as Galaxy Digital, which led a hefty $52.5 million round in July 2018.\n\nIn 2022, after the collapse of FTX, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged BlockFi with failing to register its lending product and misleading clients about risks. The firm later settled the case, paying $100 million in penalties.\n\nFor Galaxy, led by investor Mike Novogratz, Galaxy One represents an expansion into consumer-focused financial products. The platform’s mix of traditional and digital asset services aims to meet a market that has grown more cautious and more regulated since the excesses of the last crypto cycle.\n\nMore For You\n\nBrevan Howard-Backed Tokenization Firm Expands Funds to Sei as RWA Momentum Grows\n\nTokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are emerging as a key bridge between TradFi and DeFi.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Asia Morning Briefing: Regional Crypto Power Balance Is Shifting as Japan 'Ready to Pop’",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nThe conventional wisdom holds that the battle for Asia's crypto hub is a contest between Singapore and Hong Kong. Both cities have English as an official language and use Western-inspired common law in their court system.\n\nBut during Token2049, executives weren't debating whether Singapore or Hong Kong would win the title of Asia’s crypto hub. Instead, they were talking about how Japan, once written off as overregulated, had quietly become the region’s most credible market for real trading volume, staking infrastructure, and institutional growth.\n\n“Japan had no regulation for a long time, don't forget, that's where crypto basically happened, and then it went super stringent, and nothing happened for a long time,\" Konstantin Richter, the CEO of Blockdaemon, told CoinDesk during Token2049. \"But people kept on chiming away, and now they actually have a regulatory infrastructure that’s institutionally scalable and about ready to pop. Whereas here [in Singapore], it was a free fall, and now they're starting to build up regulation.”\n\nSingapore moved fast and then tightened. It opened its doors early to crypto firms, building a reputation as Asia’s sandbox for innovation. That worked, until it didn’t.\n\nThe collapse of FTX and other failures exposed weak consumer protections, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to swing toward heavy supervision in 2024. The result: higher compliance costs, mandatory custody segregation, external audits, and slower licensing. Those that don't like it have to leave, even if they aren't serving Singapore-based customers. It's a lot of work for a relatively small market.\n\n“Singapore was so crypto-friendly that everyone wanted to come here,” Richter said. “Then it built up, things happened, and suddenly you’re like, wait a minute, we do need more stringent rules.”\n\nJapan, by contrast, did its hard regulatory work years ago.\n\nFollowing Mt. Gox (2014) and Coincheck (2018), Japanese regulators had already imposed strict licensing, segregation, and onshore custody rules long before FTX imploded.\n\nBy 2025, instead of tightening, Japan is opening slightly: allowing institutional staking, setting a pathway for crypto-backed ETFs, and clarifying how firms can offer yield.\n\nUnlike Singapore’s innovation-first, regulate-later approach, Japan’s regulators wrote detailed rules for custody, segregation, and security years ago. Exchanges must hold client assets separately and use domestic validators, creating the kind of environment institutional investors prefer.\n\nRichter said Asian clients, particularly in Japan, are willing to pay for institutional-grade infrastructure, a contrast, he noted, to Europe, where customers are typically more price-driven.\n\nThe shift isn’t just regulatory. Japan's almost invisible yield – the Bank of Japan only ended negative rates last year – makes staking unusually attractive: a 3 % ETH yield is 30 times higher than domestic treasury returns. That’s why Blockdaemon and other node operators see Tokyo as the next major destination for institutional staking flows.\n\nDerivatives exchange BitMEX is also taking notice. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz said the exchange had just moved its data center to Amazon Web Services' facility in Tokyo to be closer to where the action is.\n\nJapan’s crypto framework, once criticized for being too strict, now gives it a clear edge: predictable oversight, investor protection, and rising institutional yield.\n\nNow, the question is, how will the usual hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore compete?\n\nBTC: Bitcoin surged past $126,000 in a “perfect storm” of macro tailwinds. Yet this latest breakout above $125,000 came largely from non-institutional demand. With ETF inflows paused and retail traders fueling momentum through high perpetual funding rates, BTC’s resilience above prior highs suggests whales are holding steady and scarcity narratives are deepening.\n\nETH: Ethereum traded around $4,705, extending its recent strength on renewed interest in on-chain fundamentals, upgrade optimism, and rotation from BTC to altcoins, as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added 179,251 ETH last week, bringing its holdings to 2.83 million tokens worth $13.4 billion, in a bid to control 5% of Ethereum’s supply and solidify its position as the second-largest listed crypto treasury after Strategy.\n\nGold: Gold traded around $3,960, nearing Bank of America’s long-held $4,000 target, but the bank’s analysts now warn the metal looks overbought and could face a Q4 consolidation after a 50% yearly rally, even as longer-term charts still leave room for gains toward $5,000–$7,000 if the bull cycle continues.\n\nNikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 hit another record high Tuesday, boosted by a Wall Street tech rally and strong chip stocks following the OpenAI-AMD deal, extending gains after Sanae Takaichi’s election as Japan’s next prime minister, which fueled optimism over pro-growth policies.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

BTC changed hands around $125,200 recently, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nWhile the dollar's weakness has helped the rally to new highs, the largest crypto now has clinched to new highs in euro terms crossing 106,000 EUR and surpassing its January peak, while breaking its mid-August peak in Swiss franc (99,642 CHF), TradingView data shows.\n\nBitcoin's strength extended across the crypto market.

Popular memecoin\nDOGE\n$0.2524\nand the native token of layer-1 network BNB\nBNB\n$1,299.39\n, closely linked to exchange giant Binance, gained 6%-6%.\n\nCrypto stocks posted mixed results on Monday, with retail trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) falling 3% after Galaxy Digital unveiled GalaxyOne, a new crypto trading platform that mirrors Robinhood’s core offering. The announcement sent Galaxy Digital (GLXY) shares up 7%, as investors bet on the firm’s move to compete directly in the crypto brokerage space.\n\nElsewhere, crypto-linked companies including Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL) and Michael Saylor’s parent company Strategy (MTSR) all closed roughly 2% higher. Their performance aligned with broader gains in the crypto market, where the CoinDesk 20 Index showed most cryptos saw modest upward moves.\n\nThe biggest gains came from mining stocks, which surged on news that OpenAI struck a deal to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of AI chips from AMD. The deal could give OpenAI up to a 10% stake in the chipmaker, a move that sent ripples through other AI-exposed sectors.\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Cleanspark (CLSK) each gained around 10%, driven by optimism around data center demand and possibly boosted further by bitcoin’s rally earlier in the day.\n\nBitcoin's rally is \"fueled by a perfect storm of macroeconomic tailwinds,\" said Jean-David Péquignot, CCO of Deribit, the options trading venue that was recently acquired by Coinbase (COIN).\n\nThe U.S. government shutdown is driving debasement trades into perceived hard assets such as gold and BTC, strong inflows into BTC ETFs coupled with dwindling spot supplies on exchanges are feeding a \"self-reinforcing bull cycle,\" he said in a Monday update.\n\nThe technicals also point higher, he added, with BTC's double-bottom breakout pointing to short-term targets of $128,000–$130,000, with possible upside to $138,000. However, he also warned of currently overbought conditions, suggesting that a brief shakeout to $118,000–$120,000 remains possible.\n\n\"From here, watch for volatility spikes and any shift in put volume as a red flag for near-term corrections,\" Péquignot said. \"Bulls have their eyes on $130K+, and bears might find opportunities in overbought squeezes.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bee Maps, the decentralized mapping project powered by Hivemapper, has raised $32 million in fresh funding to expand its global contributor network and scale its infrastructure, it announced Monday.\n\nThe round was led by Pantera Capital, LDA Capital, Borderless Capital and Ajna Capital, marking one of the largest financings in the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) sector this year.\n\nBee Maps is an application on the Hivemapper network, which is one of the largest decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) focused on mapping data on Solana.\n\nHivemapper enables drivers to contribute data through AI-enabled dash cams, which detect real-time changes on roads (like new signs on the roads, detours, or construction zones), ensuring digital maps can update quickly to stay accurate. Bee Maps leverages this infrastructure by rewarding contributors with its native token, $HONEY, for collecting street-level imagery.\n\nThe raise highlights strong investor appetite for Bee Maps’ vision of real-time, AI-powered maps. In recent months, Bee Maps has teamed up with major players including Lyft and Volkswagen’s robotaxi program to bring its mapping-data to their platforms.\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features and boost contributor incentives tied to $HONEY.\n\n“With this funding, we are accelerating global device deployments, expanding coverage, and strengthening our AI pipeline. Demand is not the problem — supply is,” said Ariel Seidman, the co-founder of Hivemapper, in a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nBee Maps is also rolling out a Bee Membership plan, slashing upfront costs from nearly $600 to just $19 a month. The subscription bundles hardware, software, and contributor benefits into one package, lowering the barrier for new participants to join the network.\n\nRead more: Volkswagen ADMT Taps Solana-Based Hivemapper Bee Maps for Driverless Data\n\nMore For You\n\nSolana’s Upcoming Architectural Changes and Why They Matter\n\nVanEck says Solana’s Alpenglow upgrade will make the network faster, more stable and easier to run, as developers prepare even deeper performance changes.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It also showcases the growth of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), which use blockchain incentives to crowdsource real-world data collection. Hivemapper is one of the best-known DePIN projects in the Solana ecosystem.\n\n“This is a shift from static to living maps,” said Ariel Seidman, CEO of Hivemapper, in a statement shared with CoinDesk. “We recognize that real-world autonomy depends on high-quality data that evolves as fast as the streets do.”\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Volkswagen’s autonomous driving unit has been testing its ‘Robotaxi’ fleet in recent months. In April, the company also announced a partnership with Uber to launch the service in U.S. markets, with pilot operations set for late 2025 and a wider rollout planned for 2026.\n\nContributors to Bee Maps, which is built on the Hivemapper network, earn crypto rewards for their efforts.

    "title": "Bitcoin Options Market Now Big Enough to Move Spot Prices, FalconX Says",
    "content": "The Bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,692.82\noptions market has grown so large and so structurally diverse that it is now influencing the price of bitcoin itself, according to a report by trading firm FalconX.\n\nOpen interest in BTC options has swelled to nearly $80 billion, up from around $8 billion at the start of the year, putting it on par with bitcoin’s long-established futures market. That level of growth marks a shift in how traders express views and manage risk in crypto.\n\nOptions activity, once a secondary signal, now functions as a key input for market participants trying to read or anticipate moves in the underlying asset, FalconX said. Unlike spot trades, which show where prices are now, options reveal how investors are positioning around future moves.\n\nTwo vehicles are driving the trend, according to the trading firm: options exchange Deribit and options BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which trade on the Nasdaq. Deribit remains the go-to for crypto-native traders, with short-dated options and round-the-clock risk management. IBIT, meanwhile, has quickly become a heavyweight in institutional flow, even matching Deribit’s open interest within its first year. Its options are typically longer-dated and more call-heavy, aligned with hedging strategies, structured products and yield-enhancing overlays used in traditional finance.\n\nThe diverging profiles hint at who is trading and why. A hedge fund chasing volatility may lean into Deribit’s weekly cadence. A pension fund or asset manager, on the other hand, might be using IBIT to buy long-term upside exposure with limited downside.\n\nPut/call ratios reinforce the split. Deribit’s ratio sits around 0.5–0.6, indicating a balance between puts and calls. On IBIT, it has hovered around 0.3, reflecting a tilt toward bullish strategies and structured positioning, according to FalconX.\n\nImplied volatility, another core metric, has also trended lower throughout 2025, the report found. On the surface, that might suggest complacency. But the spread between implied and realized volatility remains intact, meaning option sellers are still earning typical premiums and the market isn’t mispricing risk. This dynamic has made short-vol strategies attractive, but it may not last. A spike in realized volatility, triggered by a macro shock or regulatory change, could flip that setup quickly.\n\nThe divergence in volatility between bitcoin and ether\nETH\n$4,005.03\nadds another layer. While both assets used to move in sync, ETH implied volatility has stayed firmer, supported by staking and DeFi-related flows. BTC, by contrast, has seen steady supply from miners and other large holders selling options to generate income, pushing its implied volatility lower.\n\nFalconX’s report concludes that crypto options are no longer a niche. Their size, participant mix and strategic use now make them a vital signal for anyone trying to understand or anticipate market moves. Traders, allocators and risk managers increasingly watch two dashboards: Deribit for short-term, event-driven risk, and IBIT for longer-term institutional positioning.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "BNB Tops $1.2K in 4% Rally as Chain Activity and Institutional Demand Accelerate",
    "content": "BNB, the token that powers the BNB Chain and is used for fee discounts on Binance, rallied over 4% in the last 24-hour period, pushing past $1,200 and touching an intraday high of $1,223.\n\nThe move was fueled by sharp volume spikes, renewed institutional interest, and rising network activity. The rally aligned with BNB Chain reclaiming its spot as the most-used blockchain by active addresses.\n\nIn September, it logged 52.5 million active addresses, surpassing Solana for the first time since August, according to TokenTerminal data. Behind the activity was a sharp rise in decentralized trading and lending on the Aster Protocol, which saw its total value locked jump 570% to $2.34 billion, per DeFiLlama.\n\nSigns of retail momentum also appeared. One high-profile memecoin trader reportedly turned a $3,000 bet into nearly $2 million after a post by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao triggered speculative interest.\n\nThe surge comes alongside broader institutional engagement. Electric vehicle maker Jiuzi Holdings and Kazakhstan’s Alem Crypto Fund both added BNB to their treasuries.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that BNB has been benefiting, along with the wider crypto market, from expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 bps later this month, and from a recent upgrade where the BNB Chain reduced its minimum gas fee to 0.05 Gwei.\n\nBNB traded in a wide range over the session, moving between a low of $1,148.12 and a high of $1,223.08, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.\n\nThe price closed at $1,201.13, marking a 2.27% gain over the 24-hour window. The most notable price action came as BNB pushed through $1,200 on a spike in trading volume, with one burst of activity reaching nearly five times the daily average. That surge in volume coincided with the intraday high, which now marks a key resistance zone around $1,223.\n\nSupport emerged clearly in the $1,148 to $1,158 range, where buying pressure consistently appeared throughout the session. Each dip into this zone attracted new demand, suggesting institutional orders may be layered at these levels.\n\nThe broader trend remains upward, with price action reflecting steady accumulation and a willingness by buyers to absorb volatility.\n\nHowever, a sharp reversal late in the session signaled caution. After testing the $1,215 area, BNB dropped quickly back to $1,201, cutting into earlier gains.\n\nElevated volume during that pullback suggests profit-taking rather than panic selling, likely from larger holders capitalizing on resistance near the recent highs. Despite the retracement, BNB maintained most of its gains and held above the $1,200 mark, keeping the current rally intact.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "Galaxy Takes on Robinhood, Coinbase With 4%-8% Yield App; Stock Jumps 8%",
    "content": "Shares of Galaxy Digital rose 8% in premarket trading Monday as the company rolled out GalaxyOne, a mobile and web platform built to give retail investors access to a blend of cash, crypto, and equity investing tools, with yield at the core.\n\nThe app gives users access to FDIC-insured high-yield cash accounts, crypto trading, and U.S. equities and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the company announced in a press release. Galaxy says it’s offering 4% annual returns on regular cash deposits and up to 8% for accredited investors through its Galaxy Premium Yield product. Both rates are powered by the company’s institutional lending business, which manages a loan book of more than $1.1 billion.\n\nBeyond passive yield, GalaxyOne users can trade across digital assets like bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,731.61\n, ether\nETH\n$4,486.66\nand solana\nSOL\n$222.50\n, as well as stocks listed on major U.S. exchanges. Galaxy also offers automated reinvestment of earnings into crypto or cash, aiming to simplify compounding returns, the company said.\n\nThe launch puts Galaxy in direct competition with Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN), two of the dominant players among digital-first retail traders in the U.S. Both have launched new services this year — including crypto staking, margin trading and retirement accounts — as they try to lock in more users and increase assets held on their platforms.\n\nHOOD and COIN are both trading about 2% higher in pre-market trading alongside a general rise in stock and crypto markets.\n\nGalaxy’s move is notable in part because of its institutional background. The company went public on Nasdaq in May and its stock is up 100% since the listing. Originally built on the infrastructure of Fierce, a fintech platform Galaxy acquired last year, GalaxyOne signals a broader push into consumer finance from a firm historically focused on institutional clients.\n\nGalaxy said more features are on the way, including business accounts, crypto staking and expanded lending products.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Figure is already the top independent home equity line of credit (HLOC) lender in the U.S., originating about $5.1 billion in 2024, or roughly 3% of the market.\n\nBernstein expects revenue to rise from $341 million in 2024 to $754 million by 2027, a 30% annual growth rate, driven by Figure’s Connect marketplace. At about 19x EV/2027 EBITDA and 30x P/E, Figure trades at a premium, but Bernstein said its market dominance, profitability, and exposure to the fast-growing tokenization trend justify the valuation.\n\nFigure went public last month.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBig weekend buzz: Bitcoin\nBTC\n$111,480.33\nshot up to record highs, and its dominance rate ticked up too, signaling fresh bias toward the top cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the headline wasn’t just about crypto — Japan’s new prime minister openly backing \"Abenomics\" was an even bigger deal. That means the world’s three largest economies — the U.S., China, and Japan — are now all leaning toward easing policies. That’s a strong tailwind for asset prices across the board.\n\nIf that’s not enough to stir excitement, on-chain data shows whales are slowing their coin spending. As Glassnode points out, “Mid-sized #BTC holders are accumulating strongly, whale distribution has moderated, and smaller entities remain neutral. This points to fresh structural demand emerging despite continued large holder selling.”\n\nPut all that together, and it’s a pretty strong rebuttal to fears that bitcoin is on the brink of a year-long bear market, consistent with the so-called four year halving cycles.\n\nKeep in mind, previous bear markets were sparked by counterparty risks. Is there one looming now? I’ll leave that for you to ponder.\n\nSwitching gears to altcoins, Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN, noted that “ether treasuries now own more circulating supply of the token versus bitcoin treasuries. The market is maturing and capital rotation is deliberate.”\n\nOn the investment front, digital asset products recorded a record $5.95 billion of inflows last week, according to CoinShares data — that’s the biggest weekly inflow ever.\n\nLooking at individual tokens, Tron’s TRX aimed to break above its 50-day SMA, building on Wednesday’s rally, boosted by activity on the newly launched SunPerp platform. Meanwhile, Lido’s LDO token, which surged 7% late last week, lost steam over the weekend and slid 3% in the last 24 hours.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s $125K Resistance: Analyst Warns Failure Could Bring Bear Market",
    "content": "Ledn CIO John Glover, who correctly predicted recent bitcoin [BTC] price gains, has issued a stark warning that a failure to break above the $125,000 resistance could prove costly, potentially signaling the start of a bear market.\n\nBTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, tapped record highs above $125,000 over the weekend. The rally followed renewed demand for U.S.-listed spot ETFs amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and was likely boosted by pro-stimulus comments from Japan’s newly elected prime minister.\n\nHowever, momentum has stalled over the past 24 hours, with prices retreating to $124,000.\n\nAccording to Glover, BTC's fate is now anchored to one crucial decision point: $125,000. A decisive push above this level could bring further gains, while a rejection could lead to a more challenging bear market.\n\n\"If we do so [move above $125K], then $145k is expected sometime around the end of the year/early next year. If we reject a couple of attempts at $125k, then there is merit to the argument that we will begin a bear market for BTC,\" Glover said in an email, detailing his Elliott wave analysis.\n\nGlover belongs to the bullish camp, expecting a decisive move above $125,000 followed by a year-end rally to around $145,000. However, he anticipates that a bear market will follow a move to $145,000.\n\nSince July, bitcoin has surpassed $120,000 three times, including the recent move over the weekend.\n\nWhile the previous two surges were quickly reversed in a sharp, inverted V-shaped pattern, the latest rally appears more convincing. Prices continue to hold above $120,000, suggesting that non-institutional demand remains strong, as noted by Singapore-based QCP Capital in their daily market update.\n\nThis points to a higher probability of sustained upward momentum, pushing prices well beyond the $125,000 level.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The sharp rise in stablecoin usage could drain as much as $1 trillion from emerging market banks over the next three years as savers seek the safety and liquidity of dollar-pegged digital assets, Standard Chartered said in a Monday report.\n\nStablecoins are giving households and companies in developing economies an alternative to local banks, accelerating a post-financial-crisis shift of core banking functions into the non-bank sector, analysts Geoff Kendrick and Madhur Jha wrote.\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing among other things a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally.\n\nAdoption of these cryptocurrencies has been strongest in countries with weak currencies and high inflation, including Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, where deposit flight risks are acute, the analysts wrote.\n\nEven without offering yields, now barred under the U.S. GENIUS Act, stablecoins attract users prioritizing capital preservation, the report said.\n\nStandard Chartered forecasts the global stablecoin market will hit $2 trillion by 2028, with roughly two-thirds of demand coming from emerging markets.\n\nThe bank noted that while stablecoins threaten traditional deposits, they also promise cheaper remittances and faster payments.\n\nMany emerging market regulators are responding with digital-currency pilots and upgraded payment systems. Still, Standard Chartered cautions that unless local authorities adapt quickly, the “stablecoin summer” could become a long winter for emerging-market banks.\n\nRead more: Stablecoin Market Surges on U.S. Regulation, With Circle's USDC Gaining Ground: JPMorgan\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Crypto data giant DefiLlama earlier today pulled Aster’s perpetuals data from its tracking page after spotting XRP trading volumes that mirrored those on Binance almost tick-for-tick, raising doubts about how the newest DEX challenger was reporting activity.\n\nIf a new exchange can mirror Binance volumes too closely, it raises a question of how much of the demand is real and whether leaderboards tell the whole story.\n\nEarlier Monday, DefiLlama’s pseudonymous founder 0xngmi noted on X that Aster’s volumes, pointing out data from XRP perpetuals, began moving in near-perfect sync with Binance’s volumes.\n\nThat alleges possible wash trading or data manipulation, since organic decentralized order flow typically diverges.\n\n“Until we can get that data to verify if there’s wash trading, Aster perp volumes will be delisted,” 0xngmi wrote on X.\n\nLike other perp DEXs, such as Hyperliquid, Aster lets traders take long or short positions on crypto assets with leverage, but without going through a centralized exchange.\n\nIt recently rose to the top of DefiLlama’s leaderboard for daily fees and volume across perp DEXs, even briefly overtaking Hyperliquid.\n\nAster’s ASTER is among the hottest tokens in the crypto market in recent weeks, zooming from 9 cents to over $2 in a little under three weeks, per CoinGecko data. That has given early buyers returns of over 1,500%, making it among the best performing tokens in several months.\n\nXRP and ether\nETH\n$4,005.03\nvolumes were major contributors to Aster’s metrics.\n\nIn one wash trading risk model, Aster still showed a “low” score, but the one-to-one volume correlation with Binance raised enough red flags for a delisting. Hyperliquid, by contrast, showed a looser 0.59 correlation with Binance volumes and kept its metrics despite a “medium” score.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance itself listed ASTER with a “Seed Tag” earlier Monday. The timing drew attention because Aster counts Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao as an advisor, and Zhao has been among Aster’s most vocal proponents on X in the past week.\n\nASTER price were down 10% in the past 24 hours amid a general market retreat and DefiLlama’s data delisting. All losses have since reversed after Binance announced plans to list the token.\n\nAster did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "The Fed's Next Move on Oct. 29: How a Scenario Few Expect Could Derail U.S. Stocks and Crypto",
    "content": "The Federal Reserve’s October rate decision could trigger unexpected shocks in U.S. stocks and Bitcoin as unresolved federal government shutdown risks cloud the outlook.\n\nA partial federal government shutdown began on Oct. 1, shuttering many non-essential services including the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This shutdown has indefinitely delayed the September jobs report — a crucial gauge of labor market health expected early this month.\n\nThis data freeze comes just weeks before the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) Oct. 28–29 meeting, where the Fed’s next interest rate decision will be announced.\n\nDespite this disruption, market optimism remains elevated.\n\nAccording to GoldPrice.org, Gold prices closed at $3,886 per ounce on Friday, gaining over 48% year-to-date.\n\nGold’s 2025 rally reflects large central bank purchases by nations and strong ETF demand from private investors, driven by inflation concerns amid President Trump’s trade war, record U.S. national debt levels and efforts by some countries—especially BRICS members — to reduce reliance on U.S. dollar assets since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began.\n\nAt the time of writing, according to CoinDesk Data, bitcoin was trading at around $123,196, not far from the all-time-high price of $125,506, observed earlier in the day, driven by strong institutional interest and crypto ETF inflows.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed the week at record highs of 46,758.28 and 6,715.79, respectively, reflecting confidence in a smooth Fed policy transition.\n\nToday, bitcoin, gold and the S&P 500 are at or near record highs, probably due to expectations of further rate cuts this year and next and investors wanting to hedge against the persistent and increasing inflation that seems to currently exist throughout the world.\n\nFutures and prediction markets overwhelmingly price in a 25 basis-point interest-rate cut at the FOMC meeting.\n\nAs of Oct. 5, The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool puts the odds at 96.2% for a 25 basis-point cut and 3.8% for no change.\n\nAs for decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, it predicts a 3% chance of a 50+ bps increase, a 90% chance of a 25 bps increase and an 8% chance of no change.\n\nThe ongoing federal government shutdown conceals a significant risk. With the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employees furloughed, vital labor reports remain unreleased, denying the Fed updated wage and employment data essential for evaluating market tightness amid persistent inflation.\n\nThe Fed faces the exceptionally difficult challenge of making a rate decision without crucial economic input — essentially flying blind.\n\nThis lack of timely data raises the very real possibility that some FOMC members may advocate for pausing the current pace of rate cuts rather than continuing as expected.\n\nWithout clear visibility on the labor market’s recent trajectory, the risk of premature easing that could destabilize inflation expectations looms large. Past Federal Reserve actions during periods of data scarcity have often leaned toward caution to avoid policy missteps.\n\nAt the same time, several factors deepen this uncertainty.\n\nThe government shutdown itself creates downside risks through furloughed federal workers and potential permanent job losses, which may worsen economic growth but whose magnitude remains unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, many investors have positioned portfolios in anticipation of further cuts, meaning a surprise pause could unsettle markets and trigger volatility the FOMC would prefer to avoid.\n\nBalancing these concerns, the FOMC is likely weighing continuing a modest 25 basis-point cut to sustain market confidence and hedge against economic risks. Still, the pause remains a plausible outcome given these unprecedented challenges, emphasizing that market expectations of a cut, though strong, are not guaranteed.\n\nBetween now and the FOMC meeting, several private-sector and Federal Reserve regional data releases will provide partial economic signals despite the shutdown.\n\nIf these indicators show cooling inflation and moderating growth, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could proceed with the widely-expected 25 basis-point cut. Stronger signals of inflation persistence or growth resilience might push the Fed toward a pause, contradicting market pricing and increasing volatility.\n\nIf the shutdown ends by, say, mid-October, the delayed official September jobs report could be released ahead of the FOMC meeting, providing a clearer data picture and potentially validating market expectations.\n\nMarkets have largely ruled out a 50 basis-point rate cut because inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, especially in services where wage pressures linger.\n\nA half-point cut would risk signaling premature easing and could destabilize the labor market and inflationary expectations.\n\nPowell’s public statements emphasize caution and data dependency, making a more moderate 25 basis-point cut the prudent path.\n\nGiven the potential for a policy pause not fully priced by markets, investors —particularly in crypto — should consider hedging risk:\n\nInstitutional investors routinely employ such strategies; retail investors have a growing number of low-cost tools to similarly prepare for tail risks.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin at Historic Highs: 3 Critical Levels to Watch Now",
    "content": "This is an analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nAs bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,709.07\ntrades in uncharted territory near record highs, traders may be searching for cues on what comes next, especially key levels that could act as magnets or resistance points.\n\nHere are three important levels worth watching closely.\n\nThis level represents the upper boundary of the broadening or expanding range pattern that has been developing since mid-July. The potential resistance is defined by the trendline connecting the July 15 and Aug. 14 highs.\n\nA reversal from this level could trigger a corrective pullback down toward the lower boundary of the range, represented by the trendline drawn from the Aug. 3 and Sept. 1 lows.\n\nA breakout from the expanding range would shift focus to $135,000, where market makers currently hold a net long gamma position, according to activity in Deribit-listed options tracked by Amberdata.\n\nWhen market makers are net long gamma, they tend to trade against the market direction – buying on dips and selling on rallies – to maintain their overall market-neutral exposure. Other things being equal, this hedging activity tends to dampen price volatility.\n\nIn other words, the $135,000 level could act as a resistance on the way higher.\n\nLastly, $140,000 stands out as key level, as data from Deribit shows the $140,000 strike call is the second-most popular on the exchange, holding a notional open interest of over $2 billion.\n\nNotional open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active or open options contracts at a given time.\n\nLevels with large concentrations of open interest often act as magnets, drawing the price of the underlying asset toward them. A high open interest in call options suggests that many traders expect the spot price to approach or top that level.\n\nAt the same time, those who have sold these calls, often large institutions, have an incentive to keep the price below that strike. Their hedging and trading activity around that level can create resistance, making it harder for the price to break through.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "What SWIFT's Blockchain Means for Stablecoins and Global Banks",
    "content": "SWIFT, the backbone of the global financial messaging system, is taking a step toward becoming a full-fledged blockchain infrastructure provider.\n\nThis week, the network unveiled plans to build a shared ledger platform that will let banks settle transactions involving stablecoins and tokenized assets across multiple blockchains.\n\nWhile SWIFT has long served as the messaging layer for cross-border money movement, the new platform would put it closer to the center of value transfer.\n\nThat’s a major shift for a more than 50-year-old traditional financial organization known for handling communications between more than 11,500 banks, not for moving money itself.\n\n\"The big development is SWIFT’s changing business model to cope with blockchain disintermediation,\" said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. “SWIFT, today, does not transfer value; it sends messages. Onchain, the message and the transfer are the same thing.\n\nAcheson argued the new platform could act as a \"switching\" layer for digital currencies and tokenized assets, bridging otherwise siloed systems. However, she questioned whether SWIFT is still essential in a world of programmable money.\n\n\"Is SWIFT necessary in a tokenized financial system? No, it’s not—but it does have connections with virtually all global banks,\" she said.\n\nThose connections could give SWIFT an edge as banks look for a path into the blockchain economy.\n\n\"The industry is moving at a rapid pace, and stablecoins are being adopted globally at such a speed that traditional banks are having to take notice,” said Barry O’Sullivan, director of banking and payments at OpenPayd.\n\nSWIFT said over 30 financial institutions are already engaged with the project. O’Sullivan expects more to follow as demand and regulatory clarity increase. \"Adoption, interoperability and regulatory alignment will take time,\" he said. \"However, SWIFT is clearly positioning itself to play a meaningful role in shaping the evolving stablecoin and tokenised asset ecosystem.\"\n\nSWIFT's platform could also \"materially lower\" technical barriers and integration costs for financial institutions that want to embed stablecoins into their operations, said David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase.\n\nO’Sullivan noted that the platform could bring \"some standardization to the global stablecoin ecosystem,\" though fragmentation will likely persist. \"Existing private stablecoins, CBDCs and regional solutions may continue to operate in parallel,” he said.\n\nDuong described SWIFT's initiative as a \"watershed moment\" for both crypto and traditional finance, but reminded that it has been years in the making. The company has been experimenting with distributed ledger technology since 2017, Duong said, including conducting pilot projects with Chainlink, tokenized securities platforms Clearstream and SETL and interoperability tests with CBDCs. Developing its own shared ledger platform appears to be the next stage in that long-running transition, Duong said.\n\nStill, not everyone may see SWIFT as a neutral player. Its role in enforcing sanctions has led to distrust in countries where banks were cut off from the network, Acheson said.\n\n\"It’s not clear that its offering would stop the payment systems fragmentation, given global distrust following SWIFT’s role in enforcing U.S. and EU sanctions,” she argued.\n\nEven so, SWIFT’s decision underscores that the lines between traditional and blockchain finance are increasingly getting intertwined and the world’s largest financial institutions are – slowly, then suddenly – taking initiative to stay relevant.\n\nMore For You\n\nBrevan Howard-Backed Tokenization Firm Expands Funds to Sei as RWA Momentum Grows\n\nTokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are emerging as a key bridge between TradFi and DeFi.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "BTCFi’s Big Problem: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Haven’t Even Tried It, Says Survey",
    "content": "Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as BTCFi, has been touted as the next wave of innovation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, research suggests bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,668.22\nholders themselves are barely engaging.\n\nSome 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending.\n\nThe survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector’s promise and its actual reach.\n\n“There’s an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,” said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement.\n\nThat appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector’s trust and complexity problem.\n\nPerhaps most striking is how invisible the industry still is. GoMining found that 65% of Bitcoin holders couldn’t name a single BTCFi project.\n\nDespite millions in venture funding, BTCFi platforms appear to be speaking mainly to themselves rather than the market they’re built to serve.\n\nThe report argues that BTCFi’s adoption problem may stem from its reliance on Ethereum’s DeFi model. Bitcoin users, GoMining suggests, are more conservative: they favor custodial services, regulated ETFs and simplicity over self-custody experiments and complex protocols.\n\n“Bitcoin holders aren’t ether\nETH\n$4,486.80\nusers,” Zalan said. “Coinbase and Bitcoin ETFs succeeded because they prioritized accessibility. BTCFi platforms that focus on education and user experience, rather than complex features, will capture this market.\"\n\nFor the industry, the survey is both a warning and an opportunity. Millions of Bitcoin holders want the yield and liquidity BTCFi promises, but they need to be met with products they can trust and understand.\n\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that the survey respondents were a \"random selection\" of just 700 GoMining users.\n\nGoMining is a digital BTC mining platform that connects users to real-world mining operations through Digital Miners non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a gamified ecosystem, so the survey's findings are subject to the extent to which its users represent typical bitcoin users.\n\n\"Our user base represents the bitcoin holders universe quite nicely,\" a GoMining spokesperson told CoinDesk over email. \"More than 80% of our users open their first crypto wallet with us and enter the Bitcoin ecosystem through our digital mining product.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It involved the use of three arrows: aggressive monetary easing, high public spending and cheap borrowing and structural reforms to boost investment and growth potential.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Saturday, Sanae made it clear that the government would lead fiscal and monetary policy setting, echoing the growing fiscal dominance worldwide aimed at prioritizing demand reflation.\n\nShe said that the government and the central bank must work closely to achieve \"demand-driven inflation backed by rising wages and corporate profits.\"\n\nThe PM added that the Japanese economy is on a \"tightrope,\" and it is appropriate to maintain accomodative monetary conditions.\n\nHer comments have sparked hopes for fiscal easing, supported by low interest rates. According to Reuters, the probability of the BOJ raising rates this month has dropped sharply, and the bank is likely to be more cautious.\n\nThe timing couldn't be more opportune for bitcoin bulls and gold investors. With traders pricing continued Fed easing over the coming months, the prospect of renewed Japanese easing is likely to bolster demand for cryptocurrencies and precious metals.\n\nThe bitcoin-yen pair (BTC/JPY) listed on BitFlyer has reached a record high of JPY 18,640,000, extending its five-day winning streak, according to data source TradingView. Meanwhile, the Coinbase-listed BTC/USD pair traded at $123,100, significantly below the record high of over $125,000 reached over the weekend, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nSanae's comments also buoyed the Japanese equities, with the Nikkei index topping 48,000 points for the first time. The yen slid to a low of 150.35 per U.S. dollar, its weakest since Aug. 1.\n\nTraders have been wary of a yen rally driven by the Bank of Japan’s potential rate hikes for at least the past two years. However, some observers argue that the Japanese yen is no longer the premier safe-haven currency it once was and has increasingly been supplanted by the Swiss franc.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "XRP, DOGE, SOL See Profit-Taking, Bitcoin’s New High (Maybe) Could Still Rise Higher",
    "content": "No, the bull run is likely not over yet. Bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,669.44\nhas pulled back from its record highs, and some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) have seen profit-taking. However, this appears to be a typical bull-market breather, with analysts closely monitoring the bitcoin price action around $125,000.\n\nOver the weekend, BTC pressed above $125,000 in a tell tale sign of traders pricing an easier monetary and fiscal policy in the U.S. against the backdrop of the ongoing government shutdown. The market likely expects easier policies across the globe, including Japan, where the new PM is biased toward Abenomics, an aggressive easing strategy implemented by the former PM Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose to roughly $4.07 trillion, lifting the Fear and Greed index to 64. While that's an elevated reading, it falls well short of euphoric levels, which indicates that there is scope for more risk taking in the market. This leaves room for bullish follow-through without needing blow-off leverage to get there.\n\nThe driver under the hood still looks like spot demand and ETFs rather than a one-day squeeze, especially as BTC’s move came on a Sunday which is typically a day of thinner liquidity and lower leverage.\n\nLess-than-usual liquidations of a relatively small $65 million on BTC-tracked futures lend credence to that opinion. However, a quick retreat on Monday still suggests that some traders are unwilling to hold onto profits for long.\n\nBTC prices are down a little over 1% in the past 24 hours, with\nDOGE\n$0.2523\nand Cardano’s ADA leading losses among majors. XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB and Tron’s TRX were down as much as 2%, while ether\nETH\n$4,485.56\nlost just over 0.5%.\n\nThe outlier on a weekly basis remains BNB, roughly at $1,184 and up more than 17% over seven days, which tells us that rotations are still happening inside ecosystems when the base asset has a bid.\n\nThe increasing amount of dry powder, or stablecoin supply, supports the bullish case in BTC and and the broader crypto market.\n\nReports show stablecoin supply expanded by a record amount last quarter — about $45 billion, with roughly two-thirds of new issuance on Ethereum — and that’s the dry powder you want to see if the market is to keep going higher.\n\nAdd to that the backdrop of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown that can delay data and nudge central banks toward caution, and you get a narrative that aligns cleanly with the bullish picture on price charts.\n\nTwo expert reads mirror this setup. Nick Ruck at LVRG frames the move as a hedge bid tied to institutional flows and inflation anxiety in a take that’s consistent with ETF allocations re-accelerating on dips.\n\nAlex Kuptsikevich at FxPro notes the technical breakout and warns that long-term holders have been selling near these levels since July. Both can be true. A range break invites supply, and a trend only survives if fresh demand absorbs it.\n\n“The next step could well be an attempt to update historical highs approaching $125K,” Kuptsikevich noted. “At the same time, it is worth paying attention to the activity of long-term sellers, who have been actively selling near these levels since July: we may see a new episode of selling on the rise.”\n\nThe trader in me is inclined to treat $125,000 as a magnet and a test. Reach it fast and fail, and we’ll know supply is still in charge. Grind into it while funding stays sane, and it likely gives way.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The team behind USD1, the fast-growing stablecoin launched by Trump family-linked DeFi project World Liberty Financial, has fallen behind on updating its monthly attestation reports, a critical transparency measure for investors and regulators, according to NYDIG.\n\nAs of early October, the most recent report available is from July. That delay puts USD1 out of step with rivals like Circle’s USDC, which published reserve data through August, and Tether, which reports quarterly, Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG, said in a report.\n\n“For a project of USD1’s stature, up-to-date attestations are non-negotiable,” Cipolaro wrote.\n\nCoinDesk has reached out to BitGo and World Liberty Financial for comment but hasn’t heard back by the time of writing.\n\nWhile BitGo Trust oversees custody of the stablecoin’s reserves, the issuer, BitGo Technologies, hasn’t explained the gap in reporting. The lapse is notable given USD1’s rising profile and $2.7 billion in supply, he noted.\n\nAt the same time, USD1’s token distribution suggests most of its traction is offshore. NYDIG claims that its analysis of top wallets shows that roughly 78% of the supply sits in addresses linked to overseas exchanges.\n\nLooking ahead, USD1’s structure may conflict with the incoming GENIUS Act. The law, expected to take effect by early 2027, limits stablecoin issuance to subsidiaries of regulated banks or state-qualified entities.\n\nNYDIG also said that BitGo Technologies doesn’t currently appear fit either in the regulated banks or state-qualified entities category, meaning structural changes may be required, Cipolaro wrote.\n\nMore For You\n\nBrevan Howard-Backed Tokenization Firm Expands Funds to Sei as RWA Momentum Grows\n\nTokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are emerging as a key bridge between TradFi and DeFi.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The native token of oracle network Chainlink\nLINK\n$22.03\npulled back slightly on Friday, establishing a higher low, posting a 6.7% gain this week. The price action has been supported by a string of news headlines about institutions and protocols tapping Chainlink's services.\n\nPlasma (XPL) said on Friday it has joined Chainlink Scale, adopting Chainlink's oracle services for its stablecoin payments-focused blockchain. The network has integrated Chainlink's Cross-chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), Data Streams and Data Feeds services, supporting developers to build stablecoin use cases on Plasma.\n\n\"By adopting the Chainlink standard and joining the Chainlink Scale program, Plasma is demonstrating how new layer-1 networks can launch with enterprise-grade stablecoin infrastructure from day one,\" said Johann Eid, chief business officer at Chainlink Labs, the development organization behind Chainlink.\n\nThe news follows Swiss bank UBS starting a pilot with Chainlink earlier this week, integrating the CCIP protocol with SWIFT's messaging system for tokenized fund operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chainlink Reserve, a facility that purchases tokens on the open market using income from protocol integrations and services, bought another 46,441 LINK on Thursday, bringing total holdings over 417,000 tokens, worth $9.5 million.\n\nTechnical indicators signal bullish momentum is returning for LINK, establishing a clear higher low but facing resistance at the $23 level, CoinDesk Data's research model suggested.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "State of Crypto: What Happens to Crypto if Government Shutdown Lingers",
    "content": "The U.S. government shut down this past Wednesday, furloughing any federal employees deemed non-essential and forcing the rest to work without pay (though they should receive backpay when the government is formally funded again). If the government reopens within the next few weeks, it shouldn't have too much of an effect on D.C.'s crypto policymaking. The longer the shutdown stretches, however, the more delayed crypto efforts will be.\n\nYou’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.\n\nThe government shut down on Wednesday, and at least as of press time, Democrats and Republicans do not appear to be close to a deal to reopen it.\n\nAs discussed in last week's newsletter, the immediate effects of the shutdown are pretty straightforward: Market structure legislation will likely be delayed, federal agencies' rulemaking will probably be delayed, and new spot crypto exchange-traded funds will not launch as many hoped in the coming days.\n\nIf the shutdown is just a few days — or potentially as long as two weeks — these efforts should resume pretty seamlessly. If the shutdown goes beyond that, the picture becomes much muddier.\n\nThe longest U.S. government shutdown in history took place between December 2018 and January 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term. At the time, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives while Republicans controlled the Senate. This latest shutdown is only a few days old as of press time, and could last just a few days or may stretch on further.\n\nPerhaps the most immediate and tangible effect of the government shutdown on crypto issues is on exchange-traded funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission was expected to allow ETFs tracking the prices of assets like Solana\nSOL\n$222.04\nand\nLTC\n$116.67\nto launch this past week. While there was some movement last week and Monday, the clock ran out before all of the final paperwork could be pushed through, and the issuers have not yet been able to launch.\n\nThe SEC was able to finalize a pair of no-action letters prior to the shutdown as well. Other agencies, like the IRS, were similarly able to publish interim guidance prior to the shutdown.\n\nRon Hammond, head of Policy and Advocacy at Wintermute, told CoinDesk that, \"It can't be understated how busy the crypto policy developments have been.\"\n\nWith the shutdown, policymakers are in limbo around these types of regulatory actions, he said.\n\nOn the legislative front, one individual familiar with the dynamics in Washington, D.C. said that they do not expect the timeline for market structure legislation to change much should the shutdown end within the next two weeks or so. While lawmakers are looking to hold a possible markup — a hearing where lawmakers debate bills before potentially voting to advance them to the full Senate (or House) — by Oct. 20, 2025, this seems unlikely, regardless of when the shutdown ends, given they are still working on the text of the bill.\n\nAnother individual familiar with these dynamics said an additional complicating factor for lawmakers and their staffers is the fact that the regulatory agencies they might consult with are currently furloughed, so the lawmakers writing the market structure bill won't be able to receive feedback or answers to any questions they might have for these federal regulators.\n\nHammond said that December \"is still feasible\" for moving legislation through Congress at the moment.\n\n\"The longer this shutdown drags on, the more partisan bitterness seeps into the necessary bipartisan discourse on important topics like crypto market structure,\" Hammond said. \"Still, this shutdown drama isn't affecting our calculus on odds of market structure legislation chances of passing being more probable than not before the 2026 election ramps up.\"\n\nHammond said he was watching to see if a markup in the Senate Banking and Agriculture Committees by Thanksgiving.\n\nThis week\n\nIf you’ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you’d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Bluesky @nikhileshde.bsky.social.\n\nYou can also join the group conversation on Telegram.\n\nSee ya’ll next week!\n\nMore For You\n\nIRS Guidance Limited in Scope but Good News for Crypto Treasury Firms\n\nDigital asset treasury companies won't have to pay taxes on their crypto holdings under new interim guidance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Brazil’s Mercado Bitcoin Bets on ‘Invisible Blockchain’ Approach to Build Financial Super App",
    "content": "Twelve years after launching as a cryptocurrency exchange, Mercado Bitcoin aims to be something entirely different.\n\nLess focused on price charts and trading pairs, the São Paulo-based company now talks more about Brazil’s central bank’s PIX payments, digital fixed income, and streamlined remittances.\n\nMercado Bitcoin’s head of corporate development, Daniel Cunha, told CoinDesk in an interview on the sidelines of the exchange’s DAC 2025 conference that the firm wants to become the app where Brazilians manage their financial lives. A kind of “super app” for spending, saving, and investing.\n\nYet, calling MB a “super app” may not quite capture the essence of the strategy. Its leadership prefers a different term: a financial hub that blends legacy finance with blockchain, letting users tap into both without needing to understand either.\n\n“The revolution happens when the protocol disappears,” Cunha told CoinDesk. “The customer doesn’t want to hear about blockchains and tokens. They want to know the rate, the risk, and the maturity date,” he said, referring to the exchange’s tokenized fixed income offerings.\n\nThat thinking has reshaped how MB presents itself to users. Instead of relying on crypto-native vocabulary, the company now emphasizes features in its offering. One major change involved scrapping the term “tokenization” in user-facing materials altogether, Cunha said.\n\n“We tried a ton of variations,” Cunha said. “When we stopped saying ‘token’ and started saying ‘digital fixed income,’ things took off.” The idea is to have a product whose backend is powered by blockchain technology, but the frontend remains more recognizable to the masses.\n\nEssentially, MB’s bet is that “invisible blockchain” is the next frontier.\n\n“We’re going to see a lot of people use blockchain without realizing they’re using blockchain,” MB said. “That’s when you know the revolution has happened.”\n\nThe firm’s flagship blockchain-based investment products focus on tokenized private credit, a segment it believes is underserved and ripe for disruption in Brazil.\n\nBrazil ranks among the top five countries for retail crypto usage, according to Chainalysis’ Global Crypto Adoption Index. MB is positioning itself as an answer to a pain point common in the country through a stablecoin-based remittance service.\n\nDespite all the new initiatives, MB’s core business, crypto trading, still accounts for the majority of its revenue. But that balance is shifting.\n\nAt its peak, trading made up 95% of the firm’s income. Today, that number is closer to 60%, with the rest coming from payments, custody, tokenized investments, and services like asset management. Over time, the company expects trading to fall below 30%, Cunha revealed.\n\nAs part of that shift, the firm is also expanding geographically. It now has a client-facing operation in Portugal and is building institutional channels in the U.S., aiming to link capital and investment opportunities across markets.\n\nMercado Bitcoin, where a significant portion of assets under management are made up of small and medium enterprises’ treasuries, expects to surpass 3 billion reais ($563 million) in tokenized credit issuance by year-end. About 20% of assets under custody on the platform are now tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), up from virtually zero just a few years ago.\n\nThe pivot sits within a wider push to build “financial super apps.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said Coinbase aims to be a crypto-powered “super app” that would provide “all types of financial services.”\n\nBeyond crypto, fintechs such as Revolut and Paytm are bundling payments, lending and investing. The playbook borrows from WeChat and Alipay, apps that bundle social, financial, and other features.\n\nRead more: Crypto Exchange Mercado Bitcoin to Tokenize $200M in Real-World Assets on XRP Ledger\n\nMore For You\n\nBrevan Howard-Backed Tokenization Firm Expands Funds to Sei as RWA Momentum Grows\n\nTokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are emerging as a key bridge between TradFi and DeFi.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Many investors are currently viewing bitcoin through an end-of-cycle lens, suggesting that Q4 could mark the close of the current market cycle. However, two key metrics point to the possibility that the bull market may actually be in its early stages.\n\nGlassnode data shows that the 200-week moving average (200WMA), which smooths bitcoin’s price over a long-term horizon and has historically only trended upwards, has just breached $53,000.\n\nMeanwhile, the realized price, the average price at which all bitcoin in circulation last moved onchain, has just risen above the 200-WMA at $54,000.\n\nLooking back at previous cycles, we see a consistent pattern. In bull markets, the realized price tends to stay above the 200-WMA, while in bear markets, the opposite occurs.\n\nFor example, in the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, the realized price steadily climbed higher and widened its gap above the 200-WMA, before eventually collapsing below it and signaling the start of the bear markets.\n\nWhile, during the downturn of 2022, the realized price fell below the 200-WMA, it has only recently moved above it. Historically, once the realized price remains above this long-term moving average, bitcoin has tended to push higher as the bull market progresses.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Brazil’s largest investment bank, BTG Pactual’s crypto platform Mynt, has flagged five cryptocurrencies it believes are well-positioned for gains in October: bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,640.48\n, ether\nETH\n$4,483.22\n, solana\nSOL\n$221.96\n,\nAVAX\n$28.47\n, and sky (SKY).\n\nThe picks, outlined in a report authored by Matheus Parizotto and João Galhardo, reflect a broader optimism in the crypto market as U.S. interest rates ease and anticipation builds for new crypto ETFs.\n\nBitcoin remains the dominant institutional pick, with more than $3.5 billion flowing into spot ETFs in September and corporate treasuries adding 43,000 BTC, over $5 billion at current prices.\n\nMynt’s report describes it as a long-term anchor. “For those seeking a long-term pillar in their portfolio, BTC offers liquidity, network security, and a track record of adoption that extends beyond retail investors,” it reads.\n\nEther, it says, continues to lead in on-chain finance. BTG Pactual’s team pointed out the network concentrates the majority of stablecoin volume and real-world asset tokenization projects.\n\nOver the last six months, U.S. spot ETFs added $11.3 billion in ETH, while corporate treasuries picked up 816,000 ETH in September alone. To the analysts, these flows show institutional appetite remains elevated.\n\nSolana’s case hinges on speed and cost. The network, BTG Pactual pointed out, processed over $100 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume for the third straight month, while its total value locked surpassed $30 billion for the first time in a sign of deepening DeFi liquidity.\n\nThe analysts added that institutional demand has been increasing with the potential arrival of new spot SOL ETFs, which could lead to greater flows and visibility.\n\n“For those seeking exposure to high-performance infrastructure with growing adoption in real-world cases, Solana combines scale, competitive cost, and an accelerating network effect,” the report reads.\n\nFor AVAX, BTG Pactual highlighted its sharp growth in on-chain activity, noting that daily transactions increased by 46% and stablecoin transfers rose by 421% over the last quarter.\n\nThe network’s subnet architecture allows enterprises to spin up custom blockchains, boosting real-world use cases, it said.\n\nSky Protocol, the rebranded MakerDAO, rounds out the list. Its stablecoin, USDS, has a circulating supply of nearly $8 billion, and its Sky Savings Rate offers a variable return that’s currently at 4.75%.\n\nCoupled with a token buyback program that’s already deployed $77 million, the report is positioning SKY as a revenue-generating DeFi token with long-term potential.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "How Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Could Be a Game-Changer, Asset Manager VanEck Explains",
    "content": "Ethereum’s next major network upgrade, Fusaka, could reshape how users experience the blockchain by lowering costs and boosting efficiency, according to asset manager VanEck.\n\nIn its September crypto market recap, VanEck’s research team said Fusaka, expected to go live in December, is designed to tackle one of Ethereum’s biggest hurdles: data availability for rollups, the scaling solutions that bundle many transactions together before settling them on Ethereum.\n\nThe centerpiece of the upgrade is a technique called Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS). Instead of requiring every Ethereum validator to download all transaction data, PeerDAS allows them to verify blocks by sampling smaller pieces.\n\nVanEck explained that this reduces bandwidth and storage demands, making it possible to safely raise Ethereum’s “blob” capacity — the data slots used by rollups — without putting strain on the network.\n\nThis matters because Ethereum developers have already doubled blob limits once this year, and demand continues to rise.\n\nCoinbase’s Base and Worldcoin’s World Chain now account for about 60% of all rollup data submitted, VanEck noted, showing how central L2s have become to the network’s growth. By expanding capacity further, Fusaka is expected to cut costs for rollups, which should translate into cheaper transactions for end users.\n\nVanEck argued that the upgrade underscores Ethereum’s shift away from being driven by base layer fees.\n\nAs more activity moves to rollups, mainnet fee revenue has declined, but the firm stressed this does not diminish ETH’s importance. Instead, Ethereum’s security role in settling rollup transactions increases, reinforcing ETH’s position as a monetary asset rather than just a fee-yielding one.\n\nVanEck analysts also warned that unstaked ETH holders face dilution risk as institutional actors — from exchange-traded products to crypto treasury firms — continue accumulating ETH positions to stake for yield.\n\nIn that context, they believe, Fusaka strengthens Ethereum’s appeal by lowering L2 costs and reinforcing its centrality in a scaling ecosystem that is expected to attract more institutional adoption.\n\nVanEck concluded that while technical challenges remain, Fusaka marks a pivotal step in Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, with “significant implications” for both users and long-term holders.\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Speculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually",
    "content": "Traditional investment firms all have the same mantras: “time in the market beats timing,” “move slowly,” and “big money is in the waiting.” It’s an action plan that made sense 20 years ago, but today, it’s a sure strategy for getting steamrolled by forces most of these firms refuse to acknowledge.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that markets no longer run on just earnings reports and balance sheets; they run on stories, memes, and cultural ideas that gain momentum through social communities like X and Reddit and move faster than analysts can reliably keep track of. As much as we want to call GameStop a glitch, it’s only a preview of how markets now work. Crypto investors had an outsized role in driving this shift that spilled over into traditional markets.\n\nAnd now, retail investors have evolved from spectators to active market movers and makers, armed with platforms that let them coordinate, analyze, and act upon market intelligence at scale and unprecedented speed. While not every retail investor can outpace professional analysts, the most plugged-in communities have shown they can collectively move faster than institutions still operating by outdated playbooks. Look at Reddit’s WallStreetBets users, who drove the 2021 GameStop rally that led to massive losses for short sellers, citing that retail traders were the real force behind the market upheaval. Investors who have learned to read the cultural signals and narratives alongside financial ones will stay ahead.\n\nA Wall Street secret is that markets don’t crash because of meme stocks — they crash because of stubborn loyalty to yesterday’s winners. The historic Dot-com Bubble didn’t burst because traders shifted their attention, but because both institutional and retail investors were in denial about industry over-valuation. Instead of recognizing the underlying stories that showed early signs of tech stocks’ crumbling prices, they chose to put their trust in past performance.\n\nCrashes happen when conviction in positions hardens into blind faith and unquestioning belief, and markets force a hard reset. Speculation keeps markets honest by forcing constant reevaluation. Retail investors do this daily by actively debating a stock or token’s prospects or deep diving into company fundamentals with fellow market participants. When they engage critically and stress-test every narrative in real time, they perform an invaluable and increasingly rare service as the active asset management industry shrinks in favor of passive investing strategies.\n\nThe smartest retail investors ride a stock or token’s momentum but pivot as soon as the story changes. Their willingness to be wrong and adapt quickly helps prevent the kind of slow-moving institutional groupthink that leads to massive corrections, while still acknowledging that even retail communities can fall into faster, more volatile herd behavior. This mix of flexibility and collective attention makes them a uniquely influential force in today’s markets.\n\nRetail stock trading is up to 20-35% of volume in the U.S. and UK alone, while crypto trade volume has also surged this past month exceeding a total market cap of $4T, but the change they’re forcing isn’t numbers — it’s intelligence. They’re networked, fast, and often spot trends before your dad’s broker does. Communities on platforms like Reddit and Discord can collectively analyze news, filings, and earnings calls, surfacing insights that sometimes catch institutional investors off guard. During the AMC rally, coordinated attention from retail communities amplified price swings and forced institutional adjustments. Today, AI-driven tools and educational platforms are making retail investors more capable and informed than ever, allowing them to process data and sentiment in real time. They might not always be right, but they’re influential enough to matter.\n\nTaking a page out of what crypto has been doing for years, some companies are starting to get it: CEOs now engage directly with retail communities, and IR departments track social sentiment. They understand the passion retail investors have for their stocks and are more willing to stick with them through poor performance than with an institution that’s judged on quarterly performance.\n\nFighting Speculation is Fighting Reality\n\nIt’s 2025 and talking heads are still warning about how the gambling mentality is ruining price discovery, pointing to meme stocks and crypto volatility as proof that retail has turned markets into a casino floor. They say that embracing speculation encourages poor decision-making, market instability, and over-exposure to risk. This way of thinking misses that prices have always been driven by collective beliefs about future values. Now that more people are able to participate, it’s just happening faster.\n\nCrypto is the ultimate example. Early critics called it pure speculation, divorced from the fundamentals of market movements, but it was actually just genuine price discovery happening at warp speed. The crypto market tested more ideas in a few years than traditional VCs could explore in a decade. While some ideas were garbage, the winners were massive.\n\nDon’t throw the fundamentals out the window just yet — success involves a hybrid approach of solid analysis and narrative awareness. More often than not, a great company with a boring story will underperform a decent company with a compelling narrative. Success means knowing narratives can change quickly and taking positions that capitalize on that.\n\nBy diversifying based on assets and stories, risk management is more comprehensive. It allows investors to stay plugged into the communities and platforms where market-moving conversations are happening, while being willing to admit being too certain about any position means you may be setting yourself up for a painful lesson in market dynamics. However, it’s also about being able to distinguish between market volatility and noise, and recognizing the distinction between legitimate analysis and the misinformation that can spread rapidly in these communities.\n\nRetail is here to stay — the technology exists and the communities keep growing. By acknowledging this is the new normal and learning to navigate social intelligence and narrative-driven momentum, all investors like will thrive. The future belongs to those who are flexible and can expand their toolkits beyond earnings reports and balance sheets to a world where information flows instantly and communities coordinate buying and selling in real time.\n\nSpeculation lets investors read both the fundamentals and social sentiment to spot undervalued assets and emerging narratives before the crowds catch on. Read the signals and adapt, or watch from the sidelines.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nTokenization Could Revitalize Chile’s Struggling Pension System\n\nRecent reforms are a step toward improving Chile’s pension system — but without embracing tokenization and other technological innovations, the system may continue to lag, argues María Pía Aqueveque Jabbaz.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Robinhood Lists Strategy’s Preferred Stocks Including STRC — and Why This Matters for Bitcoin",
    "content": "Robinhood’s decision to list Strategy’s four preferred stocks marks a rare break from its own investment policies — and could strengthen Michael Saylor’s bitcoin playbook without diluting holders of the firm’s common stock, MSTR.\n\nThe brokerage began offering trading in four Strategy (MSTR) preferred stocks on Oct. 2, with tickers STRC, STRD, STRF, and STRK now available on the platform.\n\nThe next day, CEO Vlad Tenev confirmed the move on X, saying Robinhood had “heard from many Strategy investors that this was an important factor before moving their accounts.”\n\nThat detail matters because Robinhood’s own website still states that it does not currently support preferred stocks, grouping them with foreign equities and mutual funds under “unsupported assets.”\n\nThe inclusion of Strategy’s securities is therefore a rare policy shift, suggesting unusual demand from retail investors seeking exposure to the company’s bitcoin-linked products.\n\nStrategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has developed a suite of four preferred stocks —STRC, STRD, STRF, and STRK — as an alternative way to raise capital for its bitcoin acquisition strategy. These instruments function like digital credit products, giving the company fresh funding without directly diluting holders of its common equity (MSTR).\n\nEach class offers a different blend of yield, seniority and conversion terms:\n\nFor investors, this structure is important because it enables Strategy to aggressively expand its bitcoin holdings while limiting equity dilution for existing MSTR shareholders.\n\nIt also creates yield-bearing securities tied indirectly to the company’s bitcoin playbook — something traditional yield-bearing stablecoins have struggled to achieve under U.S. regulation.\n\nOn X, Stony Chambers, a Seeking Alpha analyst, called $STRC “the iPhone moment” for crypto-linked securities — arguing that its debut as Robinhood’s first-ever preferred listing shows “real product-market fit.”\n\nChambers speculated that future catalysts such as ratings coverage, tokenization, or even stablecoin allocation could trigger “vertical jumps” in demand for STRC. While his projections are highly speculative, his comments underscore how the new listings could expand retail participation in Strategy’s ecosystem.\n\nUltimately, the change gives Saylor’s firm a potentially powerful new funding avenue — and for bitcoin, another indirect demand driver as one of its largest corporate holders gains easier retail access to capital.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "‘Solana Is the New Wall Street,’ Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Explains",
    "content": "Solana’s role in the race to capture tokenized markets won new attention this week when Bitwise CIO Matthew Hougan called it “the new Wall Street.”\n\nSpeaking with Solana Labs’ Akshay Rajan on Oct. 2, Hougan said global financial leaders increasingly recognize the disruptive potential of stablecoins and tokenization.\n\nHe noted that the heads of the SEC and Bank of England, along with BlackRock’s CEO, have all signaled that digital assets could reshape payments and securities markets. Hougan added that this narrative resonates strongly with investors who understand the scale of change such technologies could bring.\n\nHougan said that once audiences begin to consider how to gain exposure to blockchain, comparisons between platforms inevitably follow. In that evaluation, he argued, Solana’s combination of speed, throughput and near-instant finality makes it “extraordinarily attractive.”\n\nHe cited improvements from 400 microseconds to 150 microseconds in settlement speed, describing the feature as intuitive for those accustomed to trading environments where execution and latency are critical.\n\nFraming Solana as “the new Wall Street,” Hougan said the blockchain’s technical edge is resonating with market participants. He said the narrative is “really resonant” and added that “you’ll see substantial flows.”\n\nAccording to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, during the 23-hour session from Oct. 3 at 15:00 UTC to Oct. 4 at 14:00 UTC, SOL traded within a narrow $8.40 range between $228.19 and $237.04, reflecting a period of consolidation.\n\nThe high was set at $237.04 around 16:00 on Oct. 3 before steady selling pressure pushed the price lower toward the $228–$229 area, which acted as support.\n\nTrading activity was strongest early in the session, with volumes peaking at 3.29 million units around 17:00, but gradually declined to just 42,637 by the closing hour of the analysis period. This sharp reduction in volume suggested weakening participation and a potential pause before a larger directional move.\n\nIn the final 60 minutes, from 13:11 to 14:10 UTC on Oct. 4, SOL broke below the established $228–$229 support zone. Prices fell from $229.84 to $228.94, a 0.39% drop that confirmed the bearish shift.\n\nWithin this window, the market showed two phases: an early rebound attempt that briefly lifted the price to $229.78 at 13:38, followed by renewed selling that drove the token down to $228.72.\n\nImportantly, this breakdown coincided with a surge in volume. The single busiest minute occurred at 14:01, when 18,011 units traded — the highest one-minute reading of the session.\n\nThis pattern of falling price alongside rising volume suggested larger sellers were active, potentially increasing the likelihood that bearish momentum continues.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

During the 2018-2019 shutdown, BTC traded in a different context. Now, the largest crypto has been closely correlated with U.S. government risk, measured by the U.S. Treasury term premiums, a relationship that suggests the uncertainty around the shutdown acts as a bullish driver this time.\n\nTraders on prediction marketplace Polymarket currently give more than a 60% chance that the shutdown lasts 10–29 days. Kendrick forecasted BTC will continue to rise throughout that period.\n\nKendrick also highlighted a coming shift in ETF investor behavior. While gold ETFs have recently outperformed their BTC counterparts with gold pushing to record prices, spot bitcoin ETF flows are poised to catch up providing tailwind for the asset, the report said.\n\nOf the $58 billion in net BTC ETF inflows so far, $23 billion has come in 2025, he said. This week alone, they attracted over $2.25 billion without the Friday session.\n\nKendrick projected that the vehicles could pull in another $20 billion investor capital by year-end – enough to keep his $200,000 year-end BTC price target in play.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Ripple Engineer Says XRP Ledger Aims to be Institutions’ First Choice for Innovation and Trust",
    "content": "Ripple cryptographer J. Ayo Akinyele says he’s pushing to make the XRP Ledger (XRPL) the “first choice for institutions seeking innovation and trust” — and to do it with privacy-first tooling.\n\nAkinyele, a senior director of engineering at Ripple, lays out the case in a blog post published Thursday, arguing that finance can’t function without confidentiality while public blockchains are built for transparency.\n\nThe way through, he says, is programmable privacy that lets “honest participants control what is revealed, to whom, and under what circumstances,” while still giving regulators the disclosures they need.\n\nAkinyele contends privacy on-chain should be a baseline protection, analogous to the encryption that secures online banking.\n\nHe points to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) — a form of cryptography that proves a statement is true without revealing the underlying data — as a mechanism for private yet compliant transactions (for example, proving KYC completion without broadcasting identities to the entire network).\n\nIn his view, without built-in confidentiality, institutions won’t move core workflows to public ledgers; without accountability, regulators won’t sign off. ZKPs, selective disclosure and hardened wallet infrastructure are meant to square that circle.\n\nBeyond privacy, Akinyele argues scalability must not come at the expense of security or decentralization.\n\nHe highlights trusted execution environments (TEEs) for fair transaction ordering to curb frontrunning and confidential computation for running sensitive logic off-chain while emitting verifiable outputs — both intended to reduce market-structure risks without reverting to intermediaries.\n\nLooking ahead, he sketches two milestones.\n\nFirst, over the “next 12 months,” he says he’s focused on making XRPL the institutional default by applying ZKPs to enable private, compliant transactions that also improve throughput.\n\nSecond, in 2026 he expects confidential multi-purpose tokens (MPTs) — a forthcoming XRPL standard — to bring privacy-preserving tokenized collateral to market. That, he says, is an essential step for institutional adoption of real-world assets (RWAs) and DeFi (decentralized finance).\n\nAkinyele also positions XRPL as “uniquely positioned to bridge” what he describes as “many trillions of dollars in assets set to move on-chain over the coming decade,” citing the ledger’s decade-long operating history, built-in decentralized exchange, escrow and payment channels as finance-oriented primitives already at the protocol layer.\n\n“The future of blockchains belongs to builders who remove unnecessary trust,” he concludes — arguing that if systems can prove correctness, prevent misuse and protect data, public ledgers can deliver the privacy, compliance and efficiency institutions require.\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Tokenization Could Revitalize Chile’s Struggling Pension System",
    "content": "For four decades, Chile has been a laboratory for pension reform. Its 1980s overhaul, based on individual capitalization, transformed retirement saving across Latin America. Mandatory contributions, privately managed by pension administrators (AFPs), built one of the region’s deepest capital markets and turned Santiago, Chile’s capital city, into a regional financial hub. Sovereign bonds were sought after, IPOs plentiful, and foreign investors saw Chile as a model of modernity.\n\nThat prestige has since faded. Low self-financed replacement rates — a median of 17% between 2015 and 2022 — left workers dissatisfied. Distrust of AFPs, often accused of charging high fees for middling returns, has grown. Then came the pandemic, when Chile’s Congress authorised three extraordinary withdrawals. More than $50 billion drained out between 2020 and 2021 — representing over 20% of the individual pension funds accumulated by 2019 and sixteen percent of Chile’s 2022 GDP. For households, this was a lifeline; for capital markets, a rupture. Liquidity fell, issuance slowed, and a pool of long-term savings once considered sacrosanct shrank.\n\nIn March 2025, Congress approved a long-awaited pension reform, replacing the “multifund” model with generational funds. Multifunds let workers choose among portfolios of varying risk, but many affiliates were ill-equipped, often chasing short-term returns or stuck in mismatched defaults. The new generational funds apply “life-cycle investing.” Young savers are placed in equity-heavy portfolios, shifting gradually toward bonds as they age. Economists argue this reduces mistakes and produces more stable outcomes. Regulators see it as common sense: align portfolios with demographics rather than market timing.\n\nThe reform also adds employer contributions, boosts The Universal Guaranteed Pension, a state-financed benefit to guarantee minimum pension to older adults, regardless of whether they contributed consistently to the private AFP system. The reform also forces competition by auctioning affiliates to the lowest-fee providers every two years instead of four. These measures should lift replacement rates, put pressure on AFPs to cut costs and improve efficiency, and spread risk more fairly.\n\nYet the reform remains cautious. Generational funds make portfolios more rational but savers more passive. Transparency is limited, switching providers cumbersome, and engagement shallow. That conservatism risks leaving Chile’s pensions modern in form but analogue in spirit. Around the world, finance is changing rapidly. Digital wallets, open banking, and tokenization are reshaping how capital is raised and invested. Chile’s model, even with generational funds, may be solving yesterday’s problems with yesterday’s tools.\n\nThe most promising innovation lies in tokenization: representing bonds or shares on digital ledgers. This promises faster settlement, lower costs, and greater transparency without altering the underlying asset. Europe has launched its DLT Pilot Regime, and Switzerland’s SIX Digital Exchange already issues tokenized bonds. Chile isn’t sitting on its hands. In 2023 its Law for Financial Technology Innovation created a regulated framework for open finance and crypto firms. Officially launched in 2020, the Santiago Stock Exchange (BCS), the Central Securities Depository (DCV) and the telco GTD launched AUNA Blockchain, Latin America’s first corporate blockchain consortium, to test tokenised bonds and shares. If managed prudently, this shift could transform Chile into a regional hub for institutional crypto investment and make initiatives like ScaleX Santiago Venture, CORFO and Start-Up Chile more dynamic by channeling digital savings into startups. Tokenization would not only lower costs and speed up settlement but also increase transparency, improve liquidity through fractional ownership, and expand market access. These features could give pensions safer exposure to innovation while nudging Chile’s financial infrastructure toward greater efficiency and global integration.\n\nMore controversial is crypto. Could Chile’s pension savings eventually include Bitcoin? Perhaps, but not yet. For that to happen, the law must be amended to explicitly recognise digital assets as eligible instruments for investment of retirement savings. The country’s Central Bank must also approve them, and regulators must enforce standards for custody, valuation, and risk. Even then, exposure would require caution. Direct coin holdings would clash with prudential rules. At a minimum, exposure should be through regulated ETFs or exchange-traded notes (ETNs), with explicit legal recognition and strict caps. Other countries’ experimentations with crypto investments show the stakes. Germany lets certain pension vehicles invest up to 20 percent in crypto. New Zealand’s KiwiSaver has dabbled in crypto via ETFs. Some US public funds have bought bitcoin products. But Canada’s Ontario Teachers and Quebec’s CDPQ lost heavily in failed ventures like FTX and Celsius. The lesson: prudence must prevail.\n\nChile could strike a balance with a dual path. Tokenised bonds and equities should be treated as equivalent to conventional ones if issued on regulated venues. In my opinion, crypto exposure, if allowed, should come only through ETFs or ETNs, capped initially at 1% percent to understand the market, but should be allowed to reach at least 25% percent of the equity allocation. Licensed custodianship, segregation of assets, and insurance would be mandatory. Full disclosure of volatility and downside risks should be required so savers know what is at stake. Such a roadmap would open pensions to innovation without jeopardizing stability. And by embedding tokenization into mainstream saving, it could accelerate the digitalization of Chile’s financial services ecosystem, setting standards banks, brokers, and insurers would need to follow.\n\nBut technical fixes alone cannot rebuild trust. Chile’s pension debate is about legitimacy as much as design. To address that, reforms could go further. Performance-based rebates could tie AFP fees to outcomes, rewarding long-term outperformance. “Open pensions” platforms could mirror open banking, offering affiliates real-time comparisons of fees and returns. Sandboxes could test tokenised fund shares and smart contracts. Allowing a sliver of savings to serve as mortgage collateral could ease tensions between younger workers, who feel locked out of housing markets, and retirees demanding higher pensions — softening intergenerational strains without undermining long-term funding, while keeping retirement goals intact. Affiliates should also share more directly in upside gains. One idea would link extraordinary profits to worker accounts: when returns beat a benchmark, the surplus would be credited back under supervisory oversight. This would make savers partners in success and keep AFPs accountable for performance, not just scale.\n\nChile deserves credit for moving where its neighbours mostly dawdle. Argentina has lurched between state and private control. Brazil’s system is vast but fragmented. Mexico’s reforms remain contested. Chile continues to adapt, however cautiously. But the stakes are high. Move too slowly, and capital markets risk stagnation, starved of long-term savings. Move too fast, and pensions could be caught in crypto storms. The balance between prudence and innovation is delicate.\n\nGenerational funds will make Chile’s pensions look sleek on paper, aligning portfolios with demographics and reducing costly mistakes. But without deeper innovation in technology, transparency, and citizen engagement, the system may remain analogue at heart. Pension design today is not only about adjusting contributions or tweaking commissions. It is about harnessing technology, safeguarding trust, and giving citizens an active role in shaping their financial futures. If Chile manages that balancing act, it could once again set the regional standard. Done right, pensions could catalyse the modernisation of the entire financial infrastructure. If not, Chile may find itself with a system modern in form but creaky underneath, destined for yet another reform and another crisis of confidence.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,582.83\nhas risen 10% this week as several groups of wallet holders switch from distribution to accumulation for the first time since August. The largest cryptocurrency rose above $121,000 on Thursday, the highest since it hit a record on Aug. 14, CoinDesk data shows.\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score, which measures the relative strength of accumulation or distribution over a 15-day period, has increased to 0.62, according to Glassnode data.\n\nThis value is above the neutral threshold of 0.5, signaling that on aggregate, market participants are looking to buy rather than sell. A reading closer to 1 indicates stronger accumulation, while a reading closer to 0 suggests distribution.\n\nBroken down by cohort, wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have swung sharply into accumulation after distributing coins just last week. Those holding between 10 and 100 BTC are also beginning to accumulate again. Retail participants, who hold less than 10 BTC, have considerably slowed their selling and are beginning to show signs of buying activity.\n\nOn the other hand, large whales with balances above 10,000 BTC remain heavily into distribution, extending a trend that has persisted since August.\n\nAlongside these shifts in wallet behavior, a notable bullish trading pattern has emerged in U.S. markets.

It’s a key player in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system, allowing users to earn yield on their tokens while keeping them liquid via derivative tokens called stETH.\n\nIn traditional finance terms, the ETF would operate like a fund that holds interest-bearing assets, but instead of bonds or cash, it would hold staked ETH. That structure would open up staked crypto to institutional investors who prefer the ETF wrapper, while removing the technical barrier of staking directly.\n\nLido’s governance token, LDO, is up more than 3% over the past 24 hours.\n\nIf approved, VanEck’s product could be the first staked ETH ETF in the U.S., adding a new layer to the growing competition among issuers racing to launch crypto-based funds.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "'Debaser Trade' in Full Force as Bitcoin and Gold ETFs Rank in Top 10 for Volume",
    "content": "The debasement trade, also known as the sound money or hard asset trade, is well and truly alive. Bitcoin (BTC), at more than $120,000, sits just a stone’s throw from its all-time high of $124,000. Meanwhile, gold has almost gained 50% year-to-date, setting fresh record highs almost daily and now trading just below $3,900.\n\nExchange-traded fund flows highlight the enthusiasm behind this trade. Both BlackRock’s iShares Trust (IBIT) and the SPDR Gold ETF (GLD) ranked among the top 10 most traded ETFs on Thursday, a rare occurrence according to Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nThe GLD saw $4.88 billion in volume, making it the fourth most traded ETF, while IBIT came in seventh with $3.21 billion. The top traded ETF was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) with more than $26 billion in volume.\n\n\"Everyone wants in on the the debaser trade I guess,\" said Balchunas.\n\nComedian and sound money advocate Dominic Frisby told CoinDesk exclusively that both bitcoin and gold share a unique property: they cannot be printed by governments.\n\nFrisby: “Bitcoin’s within a couple of percent of all-time highs. Gold’s at all-time highs. Silver’s closing in on all-time highs. It’s almost as though people are losing faith in fiat. Nothing lasts forever, of course. But those major monies which are immune to government debasement are having their day in the sun. Again.”\n\nSilver has surged alongside gold, currently trading just below $48, its third-highest level behind peaks in 2011 and 1980. Interestingly, in both of those years, silver’s top coincided with gold’s. If history rhymes, this could suggest that when silver ends its parabolic run, gold may top as well. That scenario just might create the path to even more upside potential for bitcoin.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox early morning to kickstart your day with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$122,685.01\nmay be entering a decisive phase as macro and crypto-specific forces converge.\n\nWith the U.S. government shutdown and traditional market indicators like employment reports delayed, traders are leaning into alternative assets, especially bitcoin and gold. BTC climbed to $120,000 after rallying 9% this week, while gold rose 2.9% to touch $3,900.\n\nThe shutdown has furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC with a skeleton crew. Reacting to the shutdown markets rallied, as investors see the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by 25 bps later this month as a near certainty over an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls and a delay in other key economic data.\n\n“Traders have lacked immediate catalysts, evidenced by subdued commitment following the FOMC meeting, even as gold and equities have posted strong gains. However, the broader trend remains higher as we move into a rate-cutting cycle,” Jake Ostrovskis, Head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, told CoinDesk.\n\nLower interest rates make risk assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, and that’s coming in a month where sentiment is high given historical performance.\n\n\"October has historically been a bullish month for bitcoin, and early signs suggest this year may be no exception.\" said Gadi Chait of Xapo Bank, in an emailed statement. \"Far from being a speculative outlier, bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power.”\n\nOn-chain data backs that up. Apparent bitcoin demand has grown by roughly 62,000 BTC per month since July, according to CryptoQuant, driven largely by ETFs and whales. For context, ETF holdings surged by 71% in fourth-quarter 2024.\n\nOn top of that, the crypto-native market has kept on growing.\n\n“Over the past month, DeFi’s share of trading activity has been climbing significantly, expanding both the market and our opportunity,” dYdX Labs President Eddie Zhang told CoinDesk.\n\n“A big driver of this shift is the renewed energy and participation we’re seeing out of Asia. We believe DeFi is beginning to fulfill its long-standing promise, and the pace of market adoption is accelerating in response.\"\n\nLooking ahead, crypto markets are anticipating other potential catalysts: ETF decisions for several altcoins including solana and XRP that could be delayed over the shutdown, and Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade, which is slowly moving closer.

In a post on X, Acheson pointed to a mix of strong institutional participation and broader macroeconomic drivers as new forces shaping this cycle.\n\n“In previous cycles we didn’t have this level of sustained global debasement,” she said, referencing the erosion of fiat currency value across major economies. Alongside that, she noted growing geopolitical uncertainty is encouraging a “gradual pivot away from the U.S. dollar towards global, hard assets,” with bitcoin positioned as a key beneficiary.\n\nWhile speculative enthusiasm is often part of crypto rallies, Acheson suggested this surge is being driven by deeper structural shifts — and could have staying power. This would be notably different from recent records in July and again in August, both of which were met violent selloffs.\n\n“FOMO is a strong force in the crypto asset world,” she said. “What looks like the beginning of a new momentum wave will be driven by factors new and old.

    "title": "Altcoins Set to Surge? Trump Weighs $2K Personal Tariff Windfall for Americans",
    "content": "The long-awaited alt season, a bull-market phase characterized by alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) outshining bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,564.74\n, could occur soon, with President Donald Trump considering giving U.S. citizens \"tariff dividends\" in a move that may spark riskier financial behavior among recipients.\n\n\"They’re just starting to kick in,” Trump said about the tariffs in an interview with One America News Network cited by the New York Post, “but ultimately, your tariffs are going to be over a trillion dollars a year.”\n\nTrump said his primary goal is to use the revenue to reduce the federal debt. He also said he may distribute some of the funds to Americans as rebates of as much as $2,000, in what he described as \"dividend to the people of America\".\n\nThe potential dividend, coupled with expected Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, may alleviate household budgetary constraints, spurring a greater tendency to financial risk-taking and possibly boosting investments in altcoins, which have lagged behind the largest cryptocurrencies this year.\n\nThe CoinDesk 20 Index of largest cryptocurrencies has climbed 48% in 2025, almost seven times as much as the CoinDesk 80 Index of next-largest tokens.\n\nThe tendency to increase risk-taking was described in a 2023 research paper by Marco Di Maggio at Harvard Kennedy School. It found that more relaxed household budget constraints through stimulus payments increased crypto investing. The paper added that tighter future budget constraints due to higher expected inflation also boosted crypto investing, consistent with hedging motives.\n\nThere is a precedent, too.\n\nAltcoins experienced a dramatic surge in 2020-21 as the government issued stimulus checks to support households during the coronavirus pandemic. Those unexpected freebies were largely channeled into the crypto market, which caused frenzied trading in the altcoin market. Bitcoin's dominance rate, or its share in the total crypto market cap, collapsed to 39% from 73% in six months to May 2021.\n\n\"In 2020, crypto’s institutional rails were barely in place: No spot ETFs, fragmented custody, regulatory ambiguity,\" Jasper De Maere, an OTC desk strategist at leading market maker Wintermute, wrote in a LinkedIn post. \"Retail-led rallies fueled by stimulus checks and [ultra high-net worth individual] cash, 80-90% retail flows allowed rapid cascades from majors to altcoins.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if the potential tariff dividend to the American people has a similar impact of broadening the crypto market bull run.\n\nThe crypto market's gain this year — total market cap is about $4 trillion versus $3.4 billion at the end of 2024 — is largely led by bitcoin and other major tokens, such as ETH, SOL, BNB and XRP.\n\nOne rose altcoins have failed to keep pace is that U.S. interest rates are now elevated above 4%, as opposed to 2020, when they were pinned at zero, which galvanized a search for yield in all corners of the financial market.\n\nAnother reason is the vastly larger total crypto market cap itself, which has capped indiscriminate rallies in the broader market.\n\n\"Higher rates and vastly larger market cap make indiscriminate altcoin rallies far less likely,\" De Maere said. Any coming altseason will be more selective and disciplined, driven by genuine utility rather than speculative hype, requiring rigorous analysis to separate real-world traction from vaporware.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "IRS Guidance Limited in Scope but Good News for Crypto Treasury Firms",
    "content": "New Internal Revenue Service guidance will relieve tax burdens on companies that hold cryptocurrencies and other assets, though it is limited to certain types of businesses.\n\nThe IRS published interim guidance earlier this week announcing that C Corporations — a certain type of business — generating more than $1 billion in revenue no longer need to pay taxes on unrealized capital gains under the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, a move which benefits firms like Strategy (MSTR) and Mara Holdings (MARA) given the sheer amount of Bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,596.68\nthese firms hold on their balance sheets. Both companies said they would benefit from the guidance.\n\nBrett Cotler, a partner at the law firm Seward & Kissel, said that this would primarily apply to larger corporations, including Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies.\n\n\"Crypto can be very volatile at times … [a] company's going to have a tax liability but may not have the cash to pay that tax liability, so it'll have to liquidate assets to pay it,\" he said. \"This proposal helps with that issue by saying 'for those assets, you're not recognizing them on a mark to market basis,' so it's definitely going to help the [firms] that are out there and it will probably also help other non-DAT corporate entities that hold crypto.\"\n\nBacking up, the corporate alternative minimum tax regime applies to certain types of corporations, imposing a minimum tax on these larger corporations. Treasury asset values are among the issues that these corporations would have had to pay taxes on, Cotler said.\n\nCompanies with crypto assets are similarly subject to these rules, said Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker.\n\n\"This is not a crypto specific issue. This is any company who's making roughly a billion dollars of revenue a year would be subject to that. And that's most of the S&P 500, even way beyond that,\" he said. \"It's not saying anything about crypto specifically. But the reason why crypto is related is because if you're marking up crypto, that will trigger unrealized gains.\"\n\nThe guidance is interim but still applicable, both Cotler and Chandrasekera said, meaning companies can rely on it as they file taxes next year.\n\nInterim guidance like this will usually become a proposed final rule and then will be finalized, Chandrasekera said. The IRS's guidance this week isn't finalized, but it signals where the agency is headed.\n\nCompanies won't need to file until April of next year, and could extend to October, giving the IRS time to finalize this guidance — even with the ongoing government shutdown, which halted all non-essential work by federal employees.\n\nMore For You\n\nState of Crypto: What Happens to Crypto if Government Shutdown Lingers\n\nA short-term shutdown probably won't hurt crypto's efforts in D.C. much.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Thursday that the shutdown could further weaken the economy\n\n“We could see a hit to the GDP, a hit to growth and a hit to working America,\" he said.\n\nThough historically the impact of a government shutdown on the economy has been minor, President Donald Trump’s threat to fire roughly 750,000 federal workers could have an effect in the current climate.\n\nAppetite for crypto could also be fueled by hopes for an incoming altcoin season as several applications for altcoin-related spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely see approval once the government reopens.\n\nCanary Capital’s Litecoin ETF is due for a response today with others facing deadlines between Oct. 10 and 24.

    "title": "Bitcoin to $200K by End of 2025? This Cycle Indicator Points to Explosive Months Ahead",
    "content": "Bitcoin demand has been quietly expanding since July, setting the stage for what could be another late-year rally to over $200,000\n\nApparent demand has grown at a rate of roughly 62,000 BTC per month, according to CryptoQuant, a backdrop similar to Q4 of 2020, 2021 and 2024 when prices staged sharp moves higher.\n\nSustained growth in demand has historically served as one of the backdrops for price rallies to occur,\n\nMuch of that expansion is being driven by whales and ETFs. Large-holder balances are rising at an annualized pace of 331,000 BTC, a stronger trend than the 255,000 BTC recorded in Q4 2024, the 238,000 BTC at the start of Q4 2020, and a sharp contrast to the 197,000 BTC contraction that marked the weaker market in 2021.\n\nETFs could add another layer as the products bought 213,000 BTC in Q4 2024, a 71% jump in holdings, and may be positioned to increase allocations into year-end.\n\nFor that demand to translate into another breakout, momentum on the price side is still critical. On-chain valuation puts the key threshold at the Trader’s Realized Price of $116,000.\n\nA decisive move above that level would mark the transition back into the “BULL” phase of the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator and could open up a valuation band of $160,000 to $200,000 for Q4.\n\nThe indicator compares bitcoin’s current market price with several realized price metrics — the average cost basis of different groups of investors recorded on-chain.\n\nWhen spot price climbs above those levels, the model interprets it as a shift into the “bull” phase, reflecting rising momentum and profits across the holder base. When spot price falls below, it flags the “bear” phase, signaling stress and unrealized losses.\n\nMarket conditions entering October look strikingly similar to last year.\n\nCryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has held between 40 and 50 in recent days, levels that historically mark the edge of bullish conditions. In 2024, the index broke above 50 at the start of Q4, just before bitcoin surged from around $70,000 to $100,000.\n\nWith demand metrics already strengthening, traders are watching closely for a repeat of that pattern in the months ahead.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Under the new model, traders will be able to access products such as bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,153.01\nand ether\nETH\n$4,461.10\nfutures and options through CME Globex at any time and day, with the exception of a short weekly maintenance window. Holiday and weekend trades will still settle on the next business day, maintaining consistency in reporting and clearing operations.\n\nThe move could appeal to institutions that want the stability of a regulated exchange without the constraints of traditional trading hours. If approved, CME’s around-the-clock access could give it an edge over offshore platforms that already offer 24/7 trading but operate with less regulatory oversight.\n\nCME Group's trading venue is a key marketplace for U.S. institutional investors to trade crypto derivatives.

The rise comes on the back of an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls that adds to a growing list of signals that the Fed may begin easing monetary policy sooner than expected.\n\nWith official jobs data paused due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, traders have leaned heavily on the weak ADP report, which showed a 32,000 job loss in September against expectations for a gain. Derivatives markets now price in near certainty of a 25 basis point cut later this month.\n\nBNB’s price action mirrored that sentiment shift. After dipping mid-session, the token bounced off the $1,020 support level and climbed steadily into the close, driven by volume that exceeded the 24-hour average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.\n\nTraders pushed BNB through the $1,035 resistance in the rally, which saw the broader crypto market move up 2.25%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.\n\nBNB’s outperformance of the wider market reflects token-specific catalysts. Earlier this week, BNB Chain reduced its minimum gas fee to 0.05 Gwei, making the network one of the cheapest among major blockchains.\n\nMeanwhile, Kazakhstan’s state-backed Alem Crypto Fund named BNB as its first investment asset.

    "content": "You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.\n\nHappy Uptoper! In today’s \"Crypto for Advisors\" newsletter, Gregory Mall, chief investment officer at Lionsoul Global, explains the evolution of bitcoin-backed lending in both decentralized and centralized financial systems.\n\nThen, Lynn Nguyen, CEO of Saros, answers questions about tokenized stocks in \"Ask an Expert.\"\n\nThank you to our sponsor of this week's newsletter, Grayscale. For financial advisors near San Francisco, Grayscale is hosting an exclusive event, Crypto Connect, on Thursday, October 9. Learn more.\n\n- Sarah Morton\n\nLending and borrowing have long been central to financial markets — and crypto is no exception. In fact, collateralized lending emerged in the digital asset space well before Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols gained prominence. The practice itself has deep historical roots: Lombard lending — using financial instruments as collateral for loans — dates back to medieval Europe, when Lombard merchants became renowned across the continent for extending credit secured by movable goods, precious metals, and eventually securities. By comparison, it has taken only a short time for this centuries-old model to conquer digital asset markets.\n\nOne reason lending against crypto collateral is so compelling is the unique liquidity profile of the asset class: top coins can be sold 24/7/365 in deep markets. The speculative nature of crypto also drives demand for leverage, while in some jurisdictions Lombard-style loans offer tax advantages by enabling liquidity generation without triggering taxable disposals. Another important use case is the behavior of bitcoin maximalists, who are often deeply attached to their BTC holdings and reluctant to reduce their overall stack. These long-term holders typically prefer borrowing at low loan-to-value ratios, with the expectation that bitcoin’s price will appreciate over time.\n\nThe History of the Collateralized Lending Market\n\nThe first informal bitcoin lenders appeared as early as 2013. But it was during the ICO boom of 2016-2017 that institutional-style players such as Genesis and BlockFi emerged. Despite the crypto winter of 2018, the centralized finance (CeFi) market expanded, with retail-focused firms like Celsius and Nexo joining the fray.\n\nThe rise of DeFi in 2020-2021 further supercharged lending. Both CeFi and DeFi platforms proliferated, competing aggressively for depositors. But as competition intensified, balance sheet quality deteriorated. Several major CeFi players operated with significant asset–liability mismatches, leaned heavily on their own governance tokens to bolster balance sheets, and relaxed underwriting standards, especially with regard to haircuts and LTVs (loan-to-value ratios).\n\nThe fragility became clear in the second quarter of 2022, when the collapses of the stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) triggered widespread losses. Prominent CeFi lenders — including Celsius, Voyager, Hodlnaut, Babel, and BlockFi — were unable to meet withdrawal demands and entered bankruptcy. Billions of dollars in customer assets were erased in the process. Regulatory and court-led post-mortems pointed to familiar failings: thin collateral, poor risk management, and opacity around inter-firm exposures. A 2023 examiner’s report on Celsius described a business that marketed itself as safe and transparent while in reality issuing large unsecured and under-collateralized loans, masking losses, and operating in what the examiner likened to a \"Ponzi-like\" fashion.\n\nSince then, the market has undergone a reset. The surviving CeFi lenders have generally focused on strengthening risk management, enforcing stricter collateral requirements, and tightening policies around rehypothecation and inter-firm exposures. Even so, the sector remains a fraction of its former size, with loan volumes at roughly 40% of their 2021 peak. DeFi credit markets, by contrast, have staged a stronger comeback: on-chain transparency around rehypothecation, loan-to-value ratios, and credit terms has helped restore confidence more swiftly, pushing total value locked (TVL) back toward its 2021 record levels.(DefiLlama).\n\nSource: Galaxy Research\n\nDoes CeFi have a role next to DeFi?\n\nCrypto has always been driven by an ethos of on-chain transparency and decentralization. Yet CeFi is unlikely to disappear. Following the crisis, the space is more concentrated, with a handful of firms, such as Galaxy, FalconX, and Ledn, accounting for the majority of outstanding loans. Importantly, many institutional borrowers continue to prefer dealing with licensed, established financial counterparties. For these players, concerns around anti-money laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) exposure as well as regulatory risks, make direct borrowing from certain DeFi pools impractical or impermissible.\n\nFor these reasons, CeFi lending is expected to grow in the coming years — albeit at a slower pace than DeFi. The two markets are likely to evolve in parallel: DeFi providing transparency and composability, CeFi offering regulatory clarity and institutional comfort.\n\n- Gregory Mall, chief investment officer, Lionsoul Global\n\nQ. How will Nasdaq's integration of tokenized securities into the existing national market system and related investor protections benefit investors?\n\nThis step immediately brings three thoughts to mind — distribution, efficiency, and transparency. It's a game-changer for everyday investors who aren't engaging much in traditional finance. Blockchains are becoming more scalable each year, and I love the idea of efficient, composable Decentralized Finance (DeFi) use cases for tokenized securities. Plugging these assets into our industry means we'll also see far more transparency compared to legacy systems.\n\nStats back this up — the global tokenized asset market is hitting around $30 billion this year, up from just $6 billion in 2022. This means broader distribution — imagine a small investor in rural America earning 5 to 7% yields on tokenized stocks without needing a broker's blessing. Moving from traditional finance to DeFi, I've seen myself how blockchains can optimize while also being more transparent and inclusive. This isn't just hype — it's about helping more people build wealth through smarter, digitized tools that level the playing field.\n\nQ. What are the challenges investors might face if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves Nasdaq's proposal to trade tokenized securities?\n\nIt's not going to all be plain sailing. Firstly, there will be technical hurdles that need to be overcome, and these will affect timeframes as well as user experience for investors. Mixing blockchain infrastructure with legacy systems is not straightforward, and this will likely affect early adopters, as well as the initial prevalence of liquidity.\n\nEarly investors will also need clearer guidance on regulation. There's a need for crystal-clear guidance on token rights, as investors may face issues related to events such as dividends or voting. When introducing new technologies, it is also essential to take security very seriously. Cyberattacks have spiked 25% year-over-year, and we've all seen the high-profile cases related to blockchains. Though you would assume this would be a priority for Nasdaq.\n\nAll of these issues are solvable as far as I'm concerned. So I'm not too worried.\n\nQ. Nasdaq has mentioned Europe's trading of tokenized stocks is \"raising concerns\" because investors can access tokenized U.S. equities without actual shares in companies. How will Nasdaq's proposal to offer \"the same material rights and privileges as do traditional securities of an equivalent class\" benefit investors?\n\nHere, we're talking about benefits that include access to the same rights as traditional securities — voting, dividends, and equity stakes. In Europe, investors have been able to acquire securities without full rights, which I view as similar to holding an exclusive non-fungible token (NFT) without gaining the membership benefits it grants. Imagine owning a Cryptopunk but not having access to the PunkDAO and the venture opportunities available to holders.\n\nNasdaq is essentially trying to prevent investors from getting shortchanged. This is a major benefit because you are not just getting access to a more dynamic but limited version of the asset — you're still getting all of the perks. When I think of the potential here, it's exciting — imagine fully fledged stocks with 24/7 trading, lower fees, and significantly shorter settlement times.\n\n- Lynn Nguyen, CEO, Saros\n\nMore For You\n\nCoinDesk 20 Performance Update: Bitcoin (BTC) Rises 1%, Leading Index Higher\n\nAave (AAVE) was also a top performer, gaining 1% from Tuesday.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "HBAR saw heightened institutional interest over the past 24 hours, trading between $0.22 and $0.23. The strongest move came early on Oct. 2, when the token surged from $0.22 to $0.23 on heavy volume of 57 million, establishing resistance at the upper level. Subsequent trading saw repeated tests of that barrier, with consolidation just below $0.23.\n\nLate-session volatility erased gains, with a 1% drop in the final hour as selling pressure mounted and liquidity thinned. Analysts noted declining volume into the close as a sign of potential short-term weakness.\n\nLonger-term sentiment remains more favorable. Hedera executives recently appeared on a panel with SWIFT, Citigroup, and Germany’s Bundesbank, underscoring institutional recognition of its technology. Wyoming’s Frontier Stablecoin pilot further demonstrates enterprise use cases.\n\nRegulatory catalysts may also be on the horizon, with the SEC reviewing a potential spot HBAR ETF this month.

    "title": "White House Weighing Candidates for Multiple CFTC Spots: Former Chairman Giancarlo",
    "content": "Though the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has been blazing forward on crypto-friendly policy, even as she has one foot out the door, the White House is working quickly to find a permanent successor after abandoning President Donald Trump's first choice.\n\nTrump nominee Brian Quintenz, a former commissioner, was dropped recently, and the administration has since been \"hard at work\" on announcing a new choice, said former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, who added that he was at the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\"The White House felt that they had things in hand; it didn't work out,\" Giancarlo said in an interview on CoinDesk TV. \"I'm very optimistic that soon we will have nominees that everyone will say, 'Wow, great choices.'\"\n\nGiancarlo — a longtime crypto advocate sometimes known in the industry as \"Crypto Dad,\" a name he used as the title of a book he wrote on the digital assets movement — said the White House is vetting CFTC candidates beyond the chairmanship. Without a slate of commissioners, whoever takes over from Pham would be alone at the commission, which is meant to have five members by law. Policies instituted by a single-member commission could be vulnerable to legal challenges.\n\n\"They're very aware of this,\" Giancarlo said. \"They know what they've got to do.\"\n\nA top contender for the chairmanship is Mike Selig, who has been working as a senior official on crypto policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the vetting. Any nominees still need confirmation from the U.S. Senate before they can take the jobs — a process that stalled mid-stream with Quintenz after he was openly opposed by Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss.\n\nThe CFTC is likely to be a leading regulator of U.S. crypto markets, especially if the Senate completes and passes market structure legislation that's already cleared the House of Representatives. That effort would give new powers to the smaller cousin of the SEC, granting it jurisdiction over the spot markets where crypto commodities such as bitcoin trade directly. Though the SEC has been moving quickly into a crypto-cheering posture under Trump, the CFTC had a deep history with the sector since its 2015 move to recognize bitcoin as a commodity.\n\nEarlier this week, Pham sought to assure financial-sector lawyers that the CFTC is moving forward fine under her temporary leadership, though she's also said she's hoping to leave the agency soon. Giancarlo said she is owed a \"debt of gratitude\" for what she's doing, much of which has been focused on a \"crypto sprint\" she's offered to match the SEC's Project Crypto agenda.\n\nWhile the shorthanded CFTC awaits new leadership, the Senate has been slowed by the federal government shutdown and is showing few signs of a near-term completion of the industry legislation.\n\nRepresentative Bryan Steil, the chairman of the crypto subcommittee within the House Financial Services Committee, said in a separate interview on CoinDesk TV that the current goal is \"getting this completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year.\" That's slipped considerably from Trump's initial deadline of August.\n\nThe House had already passed its version this year — the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act — with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. Steil argued the Senate can save a lot of time by \"using Clarity as baseline text\" for its work, though Senate Republicans proposed their own draft language and that's the text lawmakers have been working from.\n\nRead More: U.S. SEC Takes Preliminary Step to Expand Universe of Crypto Custody to State Trusts\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Hyperliquid Still Best-Positioned Perp DEX Despite Aster’s Surge, DeFi Analyst Says",
    "content": "A new thesis from DeFi analyst Patrick Scott argues that despite losing market share to rivals, Hyperliquid remains the most investable decentralized exchange for perpetual futures.\n\nPerpetual futures — or perps — are crypto derivatives that allow traders to speculate on prices without an expiry date. The decentralized platforms that host them, known as perp DEXes, have surged in popularity as traders move activity away from centralized exchanges (CEXes) such as Binance.\n\nScott noted that perp DEXes have expanded from less than 2% of CEX perpetual trading volume in 2022 to more than 20% last month. Hyperliquid, which issues the HYPE token, has been a key driver of that growth.\n\nStill, recent shifts have raised questions. Hyperliquid’s share of perp DEX volume fell from 45% to just 8% in recent weeks, while Binance-affiliated rival Aster ballooned to more than $270 billion in weekly trades. Other upstarts such as Lighter and edgeX also posted triple-digit percentage gains in activity.\n\nScott argued that Hyperliquid’s fundamentals set it apart. The exchange continues to generate strong revenue, trading at what he described as a reasonable multiple compared to peers, with user stickiness reflected in open interest.\n\n“Unlike volume and revenue, which measure activity, open interest measures liquidity. It’s much stickier,” he wrote, noting Hyperliquid still commands about 62% of the perp DEX open interest market.\n\nBeyond trading, Scott highlighted expansion plans including the HyperEVM network, already hosting over 100 protocols and $2 billion in total value locked and USDH, a stablecoin backed by reserves held with BlackRock and Superstate.\n\nAnother initiative, HIP-3, would allow builders to launch new perps markets by staking large amounts of HYPE, creating what Scott described as a “supply sink” for the token.\n\nScott cautioned that his thesis would be invalidated if Hyperliquid’s open interest or revenue dropped materially, or if USDH failed to gain liquidity over the next year. But for now, he maintains Hyperliquid is better positioned than competitors running heavy incentive programs.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDecentralized AI Marketplace Recall Announces Token Generation Event\n\nThe token will be used to fund and reward AI tools, allowing holders to vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Beyond the fine, ADAFSA will cut off electricity, confiscate equipment, and halt access to agricultural support programs.\n\nOffenders, both owners and tenants, may also be referred to other authorities for further action, ADAFSA said.\n\nThe energy demand from cryptocurrency mining has prompted other bans throughout the world.

The CoinDesk 20 Index — a gauge of top digital assets — is up 2.5% over the same 24-hour period.\n\nSUI climbed from $3.42 to $3.58 in the session, with technical signals showing clear bullish momentum. The token broke through key resistance at $3.56 and established new support at $3.55, backed by rising trading volume.\n\nDriving the rally are signs of growing institutional adoption. Coinbase Derivatives plans to list SUI futures contracts on October 20, opening the door for more professional traders to take positions in the token.\n\nRetail demand is also growing.

That move appears to have sparked a surge in volume, with activity spiking past daily averages during the early Asian trading hours.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, SUI has traded within a $0.19 range between $3.39 and $3.58. An early morning volume spike of 10.87 million tokens exceeded the 10.44 million daily average, suggesting heavy accumulation.

    "content": "Banking giant JPMorgan says bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,231.19\ncould climb to around $165,000 on a volatility-adjusted basis relative to gold, highlighting what the bank sees as significant upside if the so-called “debasement trade” continues to gain momentum.\n\nThe Wall Street lender’s models suggest that bitcoin would need to rise about 40% from current levels to match the scale of private gold holdings once risk is accounted for.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency was trading around $119,000 at publication time.\n\nThe debasement trade involves buying assets such as gold or bitcoin to hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies.\n\nThe bank's projection comes as retail investors accelerated their embrace of the debasement trade, pouring into both bitcoin and gold exchange-traded funds over the past quarter.\n\nAnalysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou noted that flows into these products have surged since late 2024, a trend that picked up ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe analysts framed the trade as a response to long-term inflation concerns, ballooning government deficits, questions about Federal Reserve independence, waning trust in fiat currencies in some emerging markets, and a broader move to diversify away from the U.S. dollar.\n\nCumulative flows into spot bitcoin and gold ETFs have risen sharply, JPMorgan said, with retail buyers driving much of the activity. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETFs) initially outpaced gold earlier in the year, particularly after “Liberation Day,” but gold ETF inflows have been catching up since August, narrowing the gap.\n\nInstitutional investors have also been participating, according to JPMorgan, though mainly via Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin and gold futures rather than ETFs. The bank’s proxy based on open interest shows institutions have been net buyers since 2024, but their momentum has recently lagged retail demand.\n\nThe steep rise in gold prices over the past month has also bolstered bitcoin’s relative appeal, as the bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio has drifted below 2.0. That shift underscores the bank’s view that bitcoin remains undervalued relative to gold, with its current price about $50,000 below where JPMorgan’s model suggests it should be.\n\nRead more: When Could Bitcoin Break Out to New Highs?

    "title": "Coinbase-Backed Pilot Program Hands Out $12,000 in Crypto to Low-Income New Yorkers",
    "content": "A group of young New Yorkers is receiving $12,000 in cryptocurrency as part of a new guaranteed-income experiment backed by Coinbase.\n\nThe program, called Future First, selected 160 residents between the ages of 18 and 30 by lottery to receive the payments in USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Distribution began last week through Coinbase wallets, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nThe nonprofit GiveDirectly, which has run cash-transfer programs in dozens of countries, is administering the pilot.\n\nUnlike traditional guaranteed-income trials that send recurring payments over long periods, Future First gives recipients a large $8,000 lump sum and five smaller deposits of $800. The approach, GiveDirectly says, is designed to help participants make bigger financial moves, such as paying a security deposit or covering tuition.\n\nFunding comes from Coinbase, which previously abandoned its own direct-giving initiative but redirected $2.6 million in remaining funds to GiveDirectly. Darin Carter, who leads U.S. policy and grassroots advocacy at Coinbase, told Bloomberg the program is meant to provide “financial support and crypto education for young New Yorkers.”\n\nUsing crypto instead of cash adds both efficiencies and risks. GiveDirectly says sending USDC costs pennies per transfer, far cheaper than prepaid cards or bank wires. But critics warn that stablecoins can lose their peg in market stress, and young participants could be tempted to speculate with their windfall.\n\nRecipients can cash out to banks, use Coinbase debit cards, withdraw at ATMs or leave funds in their crypto wallets to earn 4.1% interest or buy other digital assets. American University law professor Hilary Allen told Bloomberg that this setup could nudge some toward risky bets.\n\nProgram leaders plan to survey participants afterward to gauge whether crypto distribution created new opportunities or new barriers. For now, some beneficiaries like 25-year-old Luis Acero say they welcome the help. “It will give me a lot of emotional, psychological tranquility,” he said.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The surge coincided with bitcoin climbing over $119,000, a 4% gain on the day.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT has entered the top 20 ETFs by assets for the first time, reaching $90.7 billion. Since launching in January 2024, IBIT is up 175%.\n\nBalchunas noted that IBIT entering the top 10 ETFs by assets may not be far off, setting December 2026 as a potential target. “Someone asked me how long till Top 10. It is $50 billion away. If the last 12 months are repeated, it may not take long. It took in $40 billion over the past year and gained 85%. That said, those other ETFs are growing too so I don’t know. If forced, I’d set the over/under for Christmas 2026,” Balchunas said.\n\nOn Wednesday, bitcoin’s 4% rise came just short of a top 10 daily performance in 2025.

Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC remain the dominant stablecoins making up over 80% of the sector.\n\nLast month, AlloyX was acquired by Solowin Holdings (SWIN), a Hong Kong-based, publicly-traded investment holding firm, for $350 million to bolster an expansion into emerging markets.\n\nThe deal promises T+1 settlement cycles, which means securities transactions settle one business day after the trade date, and the release of selected fund data on-chain, giving investors greater transparency while keeping operations inside a regulated framework.\n\nPolygon Labs is supporting the rollout with technical integration and ecosystem growth efforts. RYT will remain exclusive to Polygon during its initial launch period before expanding to other networks, the companies said.\n\n“With Polygon-based looping to amplify utility and bank-grade tokenized MMF rails supplying the underlying cash component, RYT aims to bridge DeFi liquidity with a transparent, audited cash management layer—while keeping issuance, custody and reconciliation squarely within a regulated framework,” said Dr. Thomas Zhu, Co-Founder and CEO of AlloyX Group.\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The company will also tokenize its perpetual preferred stock (FGNXP), which pays regular dividends, making it the first U.S. exchange-listed dividend equity to transition fully onto the crypto rails.\n\nThe process aims to streamline how public equities are owned and traded using blockchain rails, while being subject to the same regulations and rights as regular securities. The tokenized shares will be settled in near instantaneously, tracked on blockchain and transferred through Securitize’s SEC-registered broker-dealer and Alternative Trading System (ATS).\n\n\"Tokenization is rapidly changing financial markets through increased efficiency and enhanced investor access,\" said Maja Vujinovic, CEO of Digital Assets at FG Nexus. \"By tokenizing our shares, we're embracing blockchain technology to further enhance the shareholder experience while maintaining the highest standards of regulatory compliance.\"\n\nThe move comes as tokenization of financial instruments, such as equity shares, bonds, and funds, is gaining momentum across crypto markets.\n\nA wide range of tokenized equity offerings debuted over the past few months, including Robinhood, Gemini, Ondo Finance's Global Markets and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance, creating token versions of the largest publicly-traded companies and ETFs. Some firms, like FG Nexus, have chosen native tokenization, a structure that gives identical rights to token holders as regular shares.\n\n\"Our project with FG Nexus is expected to result in U.S. investors being able to hold real stock, not a synthetic wrapper, with instant settlement, automated compliance and the ability to trade onchain through our regulated ATS,\" Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said.\n\nSecuritize, also known for issuing BlackRock's $4 billion tokenized money market fund, was an early mover in this sector, creating tokens of publicly-traded crypto wallet provider Exodus (EXOD) shares on Algorand in 2021.\n\nSharpLink Gaming (SBET), another ETH treasury firm, also unveiled plans to introduce its stock on Ethereum with tokenization firm Superstate's Opening Bell platform.\n\nRead more: 'Tokenization is Going to Eat the Entire Financial System' Says Robinhood CEO\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The advisory board includes Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi, Blockworks CEO Jason Yanowitz, and Aave founder Stani Kulechov.\n\nThe venture has already drawn a broad mix of institutional and crypto-native investors, including Dragonfly, ParaFi, VanEck, Galaxy Digital (GLXY), Pantera, CoinFund, Kraken, and others.

    "title": "DoubleZero Mainnet Goes Live With 22% of Staked SOL on Board",
    "content": "A new project wants to give blockchains their own “fast lane” on the internet. The DoubleZero Foundation announced Thursday that its highly anticipated mainnet-beta is live.\n\nDoubleZero is a network built to speed up how blockchain validators talk to each other. Instead of relying on the public internet, which can sometimes be slow and unpredictable, Solana validators can now connect through DoubleZero’s fiber routes, which let users transact faster.\n\nIn simple terms, DoubleZero is like a private highway system for blockchains. While normal internet routes are designed to be cheap and broad, they aren’t built for the split-second coordination thousands of blockchain nodes need. DoubleZero says its network reduces lag and makes it easier for validators to process transactions and stay in sync, which could improve both performance and reliability for end users.\n\n\"Blockchains and other globally distributed systems rely on thousands of nodes coordinating in real time. The efficiency of their communication layer directly impacts security, validator profitability and the end-user experience,” said Austin Federa, the co-founder of DoubleZero, in a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nThe project has already seen early adoption. Currently, 22% of staked SOL is plugged into the DoubleZero network. Big industry names like Jump Crypto, Galaxy, RockawayX, and Jito are contributing fiber links and engineering resources, betting that faster internet infrastructure will pay off as blockchain applications scale.\n\nIn March, DoubleZero raised $28 million and at $400 million in valuation, with Dragonfly and Multicoin Capital leading the initial funding round.\n\nFueling the system is DoubleZero’s own token, called 2Z, built on Solana. Validators and stakers use the token to access the network’s high-speed routes, with rewards tied to how much utility they provide.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a no-action letter to DoubleZero, letting them move forward with the launch of the network’s native tokens.\n\nWhile today’s launch focuses on Solana, DoubleZero’s ambitions go further. “As part of its roadmap, DoubleZero aims to expand the chain-agnostic network to support additional blockchains and high-performance distributed systems,” the team wrote in their press release.\n\nRead more: ‘Crypto’s Flash Boys’: A Q&A With Austin Federa on DoubleZero\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox early morning to kickstart your day with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nCrypto markets are continuing their rise this week after weaker-than-expected U.S. labor data and amid a government shutdown that saw the market adopt the stance that a Federal Reserve rate cut next month is a near certainty.\n\nBitcoin climbed an additional 2.15% in the last 24-hour period to $118,700, while the broader market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, rose 2.33% in the same period. The rally came despite, or because of, rising uncertainty in traditional markets.\n\nThe spark came from an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls. ADP data showed a 32,000 job decline in September, against forecasts for a 50,000 gain. With the government shutdown halting official labor data, traders are forced to lean on this miss for insights, leading to increased rate cut bets.\n\nData from Polymarket now shows traders weigh a 91% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 bps later this month, while on the CME’s FedWatch tool, odds of such a rate cut stand at 99%.\n\n“Markets appear to have responded with relative stability in the first 24 hours following the U.S. government shutdown,” Philipp Zentner, CEO and founder of LIFI Protocol, told CoinDesk. “It’s worth noting that during the last major shutdown in 2018–2019, which lasted 35 days, markets remained largely resilient, and we may see similar dynamics this time.”\n\nThat stability, coupled with a dovish macroeconomic environment, bodes well for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nDerivatives markets also reflect this shift, with open interest rising nearly 4% to $216 billion according to CoinGlass data. Similarly, spot crypto ETFs have seen more than $2.3 billion in net inflows since the beginning of the week, according to SoSoValue.\n\nStill, some warn of structural risks. “Strategies that rely on stock premiums to buy bitcoin are hitting limits,” Justin Wang, co-founder of Zeus Network, told CoinDesk. “Sustainable institutional Bitcoin adoption requires infrastructure that doesn't depend on market sentiment and stock premiums.”\n\nAs the shutdown drags on and economic signals grow murkier, investors appear to be turning toward alternative assets like gold and crypto. Speaking to CoinDesk, XYO co-founder Markus Levin pointed out BTC’s price structure is “showing a classic Elliott Wave completion within a rising wedge, a pattern that often signals consolidation before a decisive move.”\n\n“Institutional flows and derivatives activity will be critical in determining whether this setup resolves with new highs or a deeper retracement. Either way, we’re entering one of Bitcoin’s historically most dynamic months, and market participants should be prepared for volatility,” he said.\n\nStay alert!\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's \"Crypto Week Ahead\" note.\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's \"Crypto Week Ahead\".\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's \"Crypto Week Ahead\".\n\nBy Oliver Knight\n\nSpot BTC ETFs\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors\n\nMore For You\n\nGold's Historic Run Dwarfs BTC But Analyst Remains Positive: Crypto Daybook Americas\n\nYour day-ahead look for Oct. 8, 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day.

The name of the buyer wasn’t named, although the scale of the purchases points to a major mining operations.\n\n\"This milestone order represents a significant win for Canaan and reflects the robust resurgence of the U.S. market,” Canaan CEO Nangeng Zhang said in a statement.\n\nThe order also points to miners’ continued bets on the industry, even as the cryptocurrency’s mining difficulty climbs to a new all-time high.

But Anthea has recently received in-principle approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority to offer insurance denominated in digital assets.\n\nThe structure of Anthea’s policy parallels any traditional life insurance policy, except it’s denominated in cryptocurrency, so premiums, claim payments, maturity payouts and loans will all be handled in the policy’s cryptocurrency.\n\nThe approach also targets crypto investors who want protection without converting their holdings into fiat. The company also plans to integrate blockchain payment systems and explore ways to generate yield from crypto reserves.\n\n“This funding round is more than capital — it’s a partnership with investors who share our vision,” said CEO Alex Pei, noting that Anthea’s backers include experienced players in insurance and fintech.\n\nFor instance, Yunfeng Financial Group, which holds licenses from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, has a controlling stake in MassMutual Insurance, and also holds a long-term insurance license and MPF trustee qualification from the Hong Kong Insurance Authority.\n\nMore For You\n\nBrevan Howard-Backed Tokenization Firm Expands Funds to Sei as RWA Momentum Grows\n\nTokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are emerging as a key bridge between TradFi and DeFi.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "XRP Crash Brewing? Prices Continue to Print 'Lower Highs' Alongside New Highs in Bitcoin",
    "content": "This is an analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nAlternative cryptocurrencies typically move in tandem with bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,231.42\n, but the magnitude of their price swings often differs.\n\nTake payments-focused XRP as an example. Since July, every upswing in Bitcoin has triggered rallies in XRP; however, XRP has consistently produced \"lower highs.\" A lower high occurs when a price peak is lower than the previous one, indicating weakening buying pressure.\n\nThis persistent pattern of lower highs in XRP, alongside bitcoin’s new highs, signals underlying weakness in XRP’s momentum – a sign of less conviction among XRP buyers compared to BTC. It suggests that XRP may be vulnerable to sharper losses during bitcoin pullbacks.\n\nBitcoin embarked on a sharp rally in late September, reaching a new high of over $126,000 on Monday. XRP also saw buying interest, but its upswing peaked at $3.10 – well below its September high of $3.19.\n\nXRP had formed a similar lower high in mid-August, when bitcoin surged to its then-all-time high of $124,000.\n\nThis series of lower highs in XRP since July, occurring against the horizontal support zone of $2.65–$2.70, suggests weakening buyer strength.\n\nIn other words, with each lower high, the likelihood of XRP breaking below this support zone and potentially triggering a deeper sell-off to $2.00 increases.\n\nPrices need to top the latest lower high of $3.10 with high volumes to invalidate the bearish setup.\n\nThat said, as of now, the weekly MACD histogram, a key indicator for assessing trend strength and potential reversals, supports the bearish outlook. It crossed below the zero line last month and is now producing progressively deeper bars beneath zero, signaling strengthening downward momentum.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "'Tokenization Is Going to Eat the Entire Financial System' Says Robinhood CEO",
    "content": "SINGAPORE — The most important story in crypto right now is tokenization and it’s coming fast to disrupt traditional finance, according to Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev.\n\nTenev told the crowd at the Token2049 conference in Singapore that tokenization is a “freight train” barreling toward the heart of traditional finance.\n\n“Crypto and traditional finance have been living in separate worlds, but they’ll fully merge. In the future, everything will be on-chain in some form, and the distinction will disappear,” he said.\n\nWith Robinhood now offering tokenized stocks in Europe as well as private shares in some of the hottest non-public startups like OpenAI, the firm is betting big on a future where assets trade 24/7, on-chain, and globally.\n\n“In the same way that stablecoins have become the default way to get digital access to dollars, tokenized stocks will become the default way for people outside the U.S. to get exposure to American equities,\" Tenev said on stage. \"That’s why we launched our stock tokens in Europe first, it’s the future of how global investors will hold U.S. assets.”\n\nEven though many in the crypto industry have praised the direction the U.S. is going on digital asset policy, Tenev said the country needs to play regulatory catch-up to Europe.\n\nThere's no urgency to change things – such as creating regulations to facilitate 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks – because the current system works well enough already. Tenev compared it to the lack of high-speed trains in the U.S., something ubiquitous in Europe and Asia.\n\n“The biggest challenge in the U.S. is that the financial system basically works. It’s why we don’t have bullet trains — medium-speed trains get you there well enough,\" he said. \"So the incremental effort to move to fully tokenized will just take longer.”\n\nNext up for Robinhood is tokenizing real estate.\n\nTenev told the crowd that tokenizing property is “mechanically” no different from tokenizing a private company, such as SpaceX or OpenAI: you place the assets into a company structure and then issue tokens against it.\n\nWhile OpenAI called the move to tokenize its private shares \"unauthorized\" and crypto lawyers that spoke to CoinDesk said the move walked a legal tightrope, Tenev dismissed the controversy as part of a broader regulatory lag, arguing that the main hurdles aren’t technical but legal.\n\nEurope is already moving ahead, he said, while the U.S. will likely trail, but he framed real estate as the next logical step in Robinhood’s tokenization push — an asset class that could one day be traded as easily as a stock or stablecoin.\n\n\"Eventually, it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Tenev said.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

A higher hash rate signals more machines competing to secure the network, boosting security while raising the bar for profitability.\n\nThat pressure is showing up in hashprice, miner revenue per unit of hashrate ,which has slipped under $50 per petahash per second, Luxor data shows.\n\nThe metric briefly touched $52 when bitcoin traded above $118,000 earlier this summer, but has since drifted lower as difficulty rose and prices softened.\n\nFor miner margins to improve, one of three levers would need to move: higher fees, which remain at multi-year lows, a rebound in bitcoin’s price, or a slowdown in network hash rate.\n\nDespite record difficulty and falling hashprice, mining stocks have rallied alongside bitcoin’s surge above $118,500, with Cipher Mining (CIFR) up more than 51% over the past month, Bit Digital (BTBT) gaining 25%, and Marathon Digital (MARA) climbing nearly 16%\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Copper Research says usage of the Canton Network, a blockchain built for regulated finance, has quietly surged, with validator activity now including major U.S. exchanges alongside banks and infrastructure firms.\n\nJust over a year after launch, Canton has reached a scale unmatched by prior institutional blockchains, thanks to backing from Goldman Sachs (GS), HSBC (HSBC)and Broadridge (BR), the crypto custody firm said in a Wednesday report.\n\nThe report noted that Broadridge alone processes more than $5.9 trillion monthly in tokenized U.S. Treasury repos on the network.\n\nExchanges including Binance U.S., Crypto.com and Gemini (GEMI) are also running validators, while Kraken has signaled a possible listing of Canton’s token. Though no exchange has confirmed plans, Copper said that such a listing would be unprecedented for a public permissioned blockchain backed by major financial institutions.\n\nNetwork activity is also accelerating. Canton recorded more than 500,000 daily transactions by September’s end, more than USDC and USDT transfers combined in the same period and approaching Ethereum’s volumes. Copper Research stressed that this activity is already driven by live institutional applications, not pilots.\n\nAccording to the analysts, favorable regulation and Canton’s privacy-focused, interoperable design make it well-suited for shared institutional platforms.\n\nVersana, backed by JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), now has seven global banks sharing syndicated loan data, while Goldman Sachs’ DAP has supported tokenized bond issuances.\n\nThis institutional adoption is what sets Canton apart, the report added.\n\nRead more: Chainlink Chosen by Privacy-Focused Blockchain Canton to Push Institutional Adoption\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "XRP, DOGE Zoom Higher as U.S. Shutdowns, Japan Bond Slowdown Charge Bitcoin Appetite",
    "content": "A U.S. government shutdown and fresh stress in Japan’s bond market failed to derail digital assets this week, as traders positioned for looser global liquidity conditions.\n\nWith Friday’s U.S. payrolls report potentially delayed and Japanese yields climbing to their highest levels since 2008, crypto markets are showing signs of decoupling from broader macro caution.\n\nThe setup has fueled expectations that policymakers may eventually be forced to ease financial conditions, creating a friendlier backdrop for risk-taking.\n\n“The U.S. government shutdown and weak employment numbers from ADP have impacted markets this past week. Traders believe that these catalysts could be making a case for the Fed to further stimulate the economy and cut rates through the rest of the year, which could boost stocks and cryptocurrencies,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a Telegram note to CoinDesk.\n\nShutdowns that delay data and weaken fiscal visibility often encourage central banks to act more cautiously, while rising yields in Japan hint at policy shifts that could ripple through global funding markets.\n\nFor crypto, these dynamics translate into speculation over fresh inflows and renewed appetite for volatility.\n\nBitcoin traded near $118,700, gaining more than 3% in the past 24 hours, while ether rose 5.6% to $4,374. Solana added nearly 7% to reach $223, and dogecoin surged almost 9% to $0.25, extending its outperformance among majors.\n\nXRP steadied at $2.97 after volatile swings around the $3.00 level earlier this week. The broad rally lifted the market capitalization of all digital assets to over $2.37 trillion, per CoinMarketCap data.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility metrics also reinforce the picture of steadier markets.\n\n“The major theme this quarter is with lower implied volatilities, evident across equities, rates, FX, and even BTC. This has been driven by a collapse in realized volatilities thanks to an accommodative Fed, stabilizing global GDP, lack of significant tariff-passthroughs on CPI readings, and a flattening of geopolitics and tariff surprises,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, said in an email.\n\nWith bitcoin consolidating just under $119,000 and dogecoin pushing higher, the coming weeks may show whether flows can sustain momentum or whether renewed pressure from Washington and Tokyo will test crypto’s bid for decoupling.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Bureau, Travis Hill, has been nominated by President Donald Trump to take over the role more permanently, which would elevate an official who has leaned hard against the trend of debanking that plagued crypto insiders and their businesses.\n\nHill, a former staffer at the Senate Banking Committee, has sought to rethink the banking regulator's previous resistance to crypto banking and has opposed any past FDIC connection to debanking customers from industries — such as the digital assets sector — that banks may consider risky.\n\nAs with other financial agencies, the administration hasn't raced to fill board vacancies at the FDIC, leaving Hill alone among the dedicated directors, though the chiefs of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have automatic spots on the five-member board. Hill will need to be confirmed by the Senate before he can take on the chairmanship officially.\n\nThe Trump administration has been slow to install some of the key leaders at its financial regulators, including those with the most potential authority over crypto matters, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But even the agencies under temporary management have been pushing a pro-crypto agenda as Trump continues to hold the industry in favor.\n\nThe FDIC was at the center of the industry's banking crisis, and a Freedom of Information Act campaign conducted by Coinbase revealed a trove of letters from the regulator to banks cautioning them against doing crypto business. After Hill arrived at the agency, he unveiled more of those communications.\n\nIn March, Hill's FDIC reversed an earlier policy that required bankers to get prior government approval before taking on new crypto activities.\n\nRead More: White House Withdraws Pro-Crypto Brian Quintenz's Name From CFTC Chair Nomination\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Support reset to $0.242 after an early breakout, while late-session flows pushed DOGE into the $0.254 zone before consolidation.\n\nTraders pointed to SHIB’s parallel 6% rally — underpinned by record trillion-token turnover and exchange balances at two-year lows — as further evidence of institutional accumulation across meme-coins.\n\nDOGE advanced 8.8% over the 24 hours from Oct. 1, 03:00 to Oct. 2, 02:00, climbing from $0.23 to $0.25.

    "title": "Memecoins Are No Longer a Joke, Galaxy Digital Says in New Report",
    "content": "Memecoins, once dismissed as little more than internet jokes, have cemented themselves as a permanent fixture of the crypto economy, according to new research from Galaxy Digital.\n\nIn a report published Wednesday, research analyst Will Owens argues that the sector has matured into a cultural and economic force in its own right. Galaxy estimates digital assets tied to memes now represent a meaningful share of trading activity and investor interest, extending well beyond Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nOwens wrote that memecoins “capture attention and capital” by blending humor with financial speculation, making them uniquely effective at onboarding new participants into crypto.\n\nGalaxy’s research cites the growing number of users interacting with memecoins not only as traders but also as community members who build narratives, memes and digital identities around the tokens.\n\nOn the trading side, Owens notes that memecoins consistently generate some of the highest liquidity and fee volumes in the industry, rivaling mainstream assets. Their volatility, he added, has turned them into a reliable revenue source for exchanges and liquidity providers.\n\nOne of the most striking developments highlighted in the report is the rise of Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform that lets anyone launch a memecoin in minutes. Galaxy said the service has turbocharged activity in 2025, creating thousands of new tokens and contributing to record-high fee generation on Solana.\n\nWhile many of these tokens fade quickly, Owens argued the platform illustrates how memecoins are reshaping crypto’s infrastructure. He believes that by driving experimentation in token issuance, liquidity bootstrapping and trading mechanics, memecoins are helping to pressure-test blockchain ecosystems at scale.\n\nThe report cautioned that most memecoins remain speculative and short-lived, but said the broader trend is undeniable: the sector is no longer a passing fad. “Memecoins are here to stay,” Owens wrote, emphasizing their ability to sustain user engagement and influence protocol economics across multiple chains.\n\nGalaxy concludes that memecoins have moved beyond being a market sideshow, evolving into a structural component of crypto culture, trading and infrastructure.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Buyers defended $2.93 multiple times as flows consolidated, with the October 18 ETF decision window now framing the next breakout test toward $3.00.\n\nXRP climbed 5.2% over the 24-hour window from Oct. 1, 03:00 to Oct. 2, 02:00, advancing from $2.84 to $2.97. The move followed SBI’s launch of an XRP lending program for institutional payments, highlighting Japan’s push into large-scale adoption. The rally also comes as Ripple CTO David Schwartz transitions to an emeritus role and with seven spot ETF filings pending SEC decisions starting Oct. 18.\n\nThe token traded a $0.16 band (5.6% volatility) between $2.82 and $2.98. The breakout accelerated at 08:00 Oct. 1, as XRP ripped from $2.86 to $2.92 on 164.5M tokens — more than double the daily average. Subsequent consolidation held $2.93 support through multiple retests, while resistance firmed at $2.96–$2.98. In the final hour, XRP extended 0.28% from $2.96 to $2.97, hitting $2.98 before sellers capped the advance.\n\nSupport has shifted higher to $2.93 after repeated defenses, while resistance remains entrenched at $2.96–$2.98. The breakout was validated by volume spikes — including a 4.8M burst during the late-session rally — signaling institutional demand underpinning the move.

    "title": "Bullish to Offer Bitcoin Options Trading With Top-Tier Consortium of Trading Partners",
    "content": "Bullish (BLSH), the NYSE-listed digital assets platform focused on institutional investors and parent company of CoinDesk, will tentatively launch crypto options trading from Oct. 8.\n\nThese bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,673.42\noptions will be margined and settled in the regulated, dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, which boasts a market cap of $73.85 billion at press time, the second-largest in the stablecoin industry. Additionally, they will be European-style options with expiries ranging from three weeks to three months. The contract multiplier will be 1, meaning one contract represents one full BTC.\n\nThe exchange plans to list options tied to ether, as well as other single assets and multi-asset indices, such as the CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 5, in the future.\n\nBullish's decision to launch options is part of a broader industry trend marked by increasing demand for hedging instruments across the full spectrum of crypto products. This growing appetite is exemplified by the rising popularity of options tied to BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, which now rivals Deribit's BTC options.\n\n\"Bullish is investing significantly in its institutional offering,” said Chris Tyrer, President of Bullish Exchange. “Our journey began with spot trading, expanded to include margin, then perpetual and dated futures, and now reaches a new milestone with the introduction of options.\"\n\nHe added that the new product aims to deliver a complete derivatives product suite with capital efficiency and risk mitigation, all accessible through a single, unified trading account.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific asset, such as bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, at a predetermined price within a set time frame. A call option gives the right to buy, representing a bullish bet on the market, while a put protects against potential price losses.\n\nThe special thing about options is that they facilitate three-dimensional trading, allowing traders to bet on the price direction, the degree of price volatility and leverage time to expiration. This multi-faceted nature enables traders to create synthetic positions by combining spot, futures, and options markets, allowing them to manage risk with more tailored and flexible strategies.\n\nBullish's new options have been designed in close collaboration with leading options market makers, technology providers, and brokers to ensure they are specifically tailored to meet the needs of institutional investors.\n\nMore importantly, from day one, these options will be supported by a range of confirmed industry heavyweights as trading partners, including Abraxas Capital Management, Ampersan, B2C2, BlockTech, Cumberland, FalconX, Fig Markets, Flow Traders, Galaxy Digital, Monarq Asset Management, Pulsar, SignalPlus, Wintermute, and Qube Research & Technologies.\n\n“Galaxy is excited to support the next chapter of Bullish’s journey,” said Jason Urban, Global Head of Trading at Galaxy. “The addition of options to its product suite is a strong step forward – enhancing liquidity, deepening price discovery, and strengthening the overall maturity of the crypto derivatives market.”\n\nThe global crypto options market is valued at over $50 billion in notional open interest, with Deribit alone accounting for more than 80% of the activity. In other words, the exchange has a massive head start compared to the impending Bullish options contracts.\n\nBullish's announcement stands out due to the platform's unified margin system, according to Tyrer.\n\n\"Bullish clients access all products via our unified account structure, allowing them to trade spot, perps, dated futures and now options with risk offsets and portfolio collateralization. This setup is designed for maximum capital efficiency, which is of paramount importance to our institutional client base,\" Chris Tyrer, President of Bullish Exchange, said.\n\nOn Deribit, Segregated Standard Margin is the default margin system, which means that standard margin, the initial margin and maintenance margin (MM) requirements are calculated separately for each position in the account. These requirements are then summed together to generate the total margin requirements for the account.\n\nHowever, Deribit allows users to choose from four distinct margin systems depending on their trading style and risk management preferences, including the default option.\n\nThe other three are: Cross standard margin, which lets traders use funds from one asset as collateral to support positions in another; segregated portfolio margin, which calculates margin based on the net risk of the entire portfolio but keeps collateral separated by asset; and cross portfolio margin, the most flexible option, which combines cross-collateral capabilities with portfolio-level risk calculations to optimize margin usage across all positions and assets.\n\nLastly, Bullish already has vibrant futures and spot markets, which are often seen as a prerequisite for a successful options product.\n\nSince its launch in November 2021, Bullish has surpassed $1.5 trillion in cumulative trading volume. This year, the platform has executed over $2 billion in average daily volume and ranks in the top ten exchanges by spot volume for bitcoin and ether.\n\nThe business is licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services, German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, and the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission.\n\n11:05 UTC: Adds more on Deribit's margin\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, is continuing his inquiry into whether Dan Morehead, the founder of asset manager Pantera Capital, sought to avoid paying taxes through his move to Puerto Rico.\n\nWyden's probe into whether Morehead committed tax evasion began in January, and is focused on how the Pantera founder reported taxes on his share of proceeds after a large crypto sale by the firm. According to a press release, Wyden is specifically looking at whether Morehead \"misrepresent[ed] his residency status\" when Pantera generated over $1 billion in capital gains from crypto sales by claiming his profits from the sale came while he was in Puerto Rico. Residents of the U.S. territory do not pay income tax on capital gains.\n\n\"It is my understanding your share of these gains … was hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Wyden said in the letter, sent on Wednesday. \"It is also my understanding that you treated the entire [gain] as exempt from U.S. tax, even though the lion’s share of these gains accrued while you still resided in California. These are serious allegations of potential abuse of Puerto Rico tax incentives to avoid the payment of U.S. taxes that you must immediately address.\"\n\nWyden's letter alleged that Morehead's attorneys \"have all but disappeared\" despite initially engaging with his staff. He also said in the letter that he believes Morehead was advised by Jeffrey Rubinger, a Miami-based attorney who advised another client who \"recently pled guilty to a tax fraud scheme\" tied to the same Puerto Rico tax rules.\n\nA Pantera spokesperson referred CoinDesk to a previous statement from Morehead, when he told the New York Times in a statement earlier this year that, \"I believe I acted appropriately with respect to my taxes.\"\n\nWyden's probe does not carry the full weight of an investigation by the Senate Finance Committee at the moment, given Democrats are the minority party in the Senate and committee Chair Mike Crapo — the top Republican on the committee — does not appear to have joined in the inquiry at this time.\n\nWyden's letter came the same day the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on crypto tax issues specifically. Witnesses at the hearing warned that the IRS may soon face a deluge of tax reporting.\n\nRead more: U.S. Senate Hearing on Crypto Taxes Reveals Headaches for Both Industry and IRS\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "U.S. Senate Hearing on Crypto Taxes Reveals Headaches for Both Industry and IRS",
    "content": "A top tax executive for U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase suggested to U.S. senators at a Wednesday hearing that the Internal Revenue Service is ill equipped to handle the kind of tax reporting already in the works under current rules and that may be produced in future regulations.\n\n\"The IRS is probably unprepared today to endure or to absorb the amount of information that Coinbase alone will be providing,\" said Lawrence Zlatkin, vice president for tax at the exchange, during a Senate Finance Committee hearing examining the U.S. approach to taxing the crypto sector. \"We're going to be testing that in a little while.\"\n\nHe said it's important to consider administrability — what the agency can realistically manage — as the future rules are contemplated, because \"this is one asset class that is so democratized that we are talking about billions of transactions.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department's IRS had recently established the crypto brokerage forms that will deluge the federal tax offices, but there are several major crypto taxation questions still hanging. Some of them — such as whether to ignore any minor gains on small-scale transactions (the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption) or to delay the taxability of staking gains until they're sold — are at the center of congressional discussions on digital assets legislation. But it remains unclear which ones will get attention and when, leaving significant uncertainty for crypto businesses and investors.\n\n\"Our tax code does not provide straightforward answers for many digital asset transactions, whether someone is buying a cup of coffee, donating to a charity, investing, lending, mining or staking,\" Senator Mike Crapo, the panel's chairman, offered in summary. \"Without clear tax rules, taxpayers are left with many unanswered questions.\"\n\nThough many of the panel's Democrats focused some of their remarks on the federal government shutdown heading into its first day on Wednesday, they also devoted attention to what they characterized as the industry's longstanding avoidance of U.S. taxes on gains and — in Senator Elizabeth Warren's case, the efforts of crypto lobbyists who \"want special tax rules for crypto that will make crypto billionaires richer.\"\n\nWhile Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon lawmaker who is the committee's ranking Democrat, granted that the crypto sector needs Congress' attention on tax matters, he added that \"there’s a pretty long list of major issues and problems this committee ought to look at first.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the IRS has been a particular target of the administration, which has cut thousands of staff from its workforce. While the agency has recently maintained a crypto office, its top officials have abandoned it — most recently with the departure of Trish Turner — and the IRS hasn't responded to CoinDesk questions about the office's ongoing status.\n\nAmong the crypto industry's chief asks are that de minimis transactions be exempted from tax hassles, certain rewards stop being treated as income when first issued and that stablecoins should also be exempted from gain considerations, because they're meant to reflect the value of a dollar.\n\nIn July, Senator Cynthia Lummis — the Wyoming Republican who leads the crypto subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee — introduced a standalone bill that would address many of the industry top tax concerns, including setting a $300 de minimis threshold. But it's unclear what the Senate will do with those ideas.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, prominent crypto firms began praising new guidance that just emerged from the IRS, potentially freeing them from certain tax burdens.\n\nStrategy's Michael Saylor posted on social media site X that the IRS guidance means his company \"does not expect to be subject to the Corporate Alternate Minimum Tax (CAMT) due to unrealized gains on its bitcoin holdings.\" And bitcoin mining company MARA similarly called it \"a positive development for MARA and our shareholders.\"\n\nBut even that possible boon came from initial guidance — a tentative document signaling a likely future policy that's not yet enacted.\n\nRead More: U.S. Digital Assets Tax Policy Getting Hearing During 'Crypto Week'\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Stocks printed fresh records and gold is on a tear crossing $3,900, but the last leg higher in traditional markets left bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,243.46\nbehind.\n\nThe largest crypto, often touted as digital gold, has been stuck in a $100,000–$120,000 range for nearly three months after setting new highs in July and August.\n\nThe lag fits a pattern. Over the past couple of years, gold and bitcoin have taken turns: when gold breaks out, bitcoin tends to consolidate; when gold cools, BTC often resumes the advance.\n\nFrom January into April, BTC plunged about 30% while gold kicked off its next leg, rising roughly 28% to $3,500 at the height of the global tariff tantrum. Gold then stalled into August, and bitcoin took the baton, rallying about 60% from trough to peak to notch fresh records.\n\n\"Gold likes low rates and a weak economy, whereas bitcoin likes them firm,\" said Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree, in a recent report. \"Because bitcoin likes a super strong economy, and low rates are associated with economic slumps.\" He added that the BTC–gold relationship is loose: the 90-day correlation has averaged around 0.1 — \"basically zero.\"\n\nRight now, gold is in a lockout rally toward $4,000, up about 17% across a seven-week winning streak. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still ranging below $120,000.\n\nIf the recent rhythm holds, a pause in gold, or even a sideways drift, could be the tell for BTC’s next break out of the range and another run at records.\n\n\"The good news for bitcoin is that sooner or later, gold will get tired,\" Morris said.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin Tops $119K, XRP, SOL, ETH Surge as U.S. Government Shutdown Takes Effect; BTC Options Look Cheap",
    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,291.32\njumped to its highest in over two months as the U.S. government shut down operations, likely setting the stage for a positive fiat liquidity impulse.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency has risen nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, with prices briefly rising to $119,455 for the first time since mid-August, CoinDesk data show. Other major tokens such as ether\nETH\n$4,512.09\n,\nXRP\n$2.8832\n, solana\nSOL\n$222.44\nand\nDOGE\n$0.2542\nhave risen 4% to 7%. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has jumped 5% to 4,217 points.\n\nThe rally follows a U.S. government shutdown on Wednesday after a deeply divided Congress prevented officials from reaching a funding deal.\n\nThe shutdown could delay Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, the official monthly jobs figure, which would eventually set the stage for a positive liquidity impulse or expansion of liquidity in the financial system. This often results in easier access to funding, reduces cost of borrowing and encourages economic growth and risk-taking in financial markets.\n\n\"If ADP is a leading signal and the BLS print is delayed, the Fed is likely to deliver a 25 bp cut in October and pair it with guidance that keeps a second cut on the table by December, alongside an early nod toward tapering quantitative tightening (QT). That mix should pull real yields lower and soften the dollar into Q4, with a mild bear-steepening in the curve and gold staying bid. Net effect: a positive liquidity impulse that historically supports BTC,\" Matt Mena, Crypto Research Strategist at 21Shares said in an email.\n\nWednesday's ADP private payrolls report painted a bleak picture of the labor market, strengthening the case for continued rate cuts by the Fed. The central bank cut rates by 25 basis points last month, while hinting at additional easing in the coming months.\n\nMena added that BTC's price gain in the wake of the government shutdown could be a hint of an impending explosive rally.\n\n\"The message is clear: with traditional data releases in flux and macro uncertainty running high, Bitcoin remains one of the few assets that thrives when the old playbook breaks down. Investors should be watching this moment closely - it could mark the next explosive leg higher in crypto markets,\" he noted.\n\nOne way to play the impending big move, while being hedged, could be through Deribit-listed options, which look cheap at the front-end, according to Amberdata's Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini.\n\n\"After a long 'dry spell' for BTC volatility, the U.S. government shutdown could finally be the catalyst to make BTC move a lot,\" Magadini told CoinDesk. \"This, coupled with the steep contango in implied volatility term structure, makes options look cheap.\"\n\nThe steep contango in the implied volatility (IV) term structure, represented by an upward-sloping IV curve from near-term to longer-term maturities, indicates that the market expects future volatility to be significantly higher than the near-term volatility.\n\nThis makes near-term options relatively cheap. Option prices are influenced by implied volatility.\n\nMagadini cited long straddle as one of the preferred strategies to play the impending volatility boom. It involves the simultaneous purchase of both call and put options at the same strike price and with the same expiry. The call option gains value when the underlying asset’s price rises, while the put option provides protection against price declines. Together, this means the straddle buyer profits from significant price movements in either direction.\n\n\"The USD is likely to see flows on the back of the Shutdown and this week's payroll number... which will guide the Fed. These catalysts could either cause BTC to rally (as a dollar hedge) or crash (if risk assets panic),\" he said, explaining the bias for straddle.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Legacy Users ‘Not Forgotten’ as OpenSea Balances Newcomers, OGs Ahead of Token Launch: CMO Hollander",
    "content": "Once the face of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), OpenSea is in the middle of a reinvention. The marketplace that helped turn digital collectibles into a global craze is now trying to position itself as a Web3 home where users can seamlessly trade not just NFTs but also tokens and, eventually, a broader range of DeFi activity and other on-chain assets.\n\nEarlier this year, the OpenSea Foundation announced that it would be coming out with a SEA token, creating much anticipation around what the token would be used for and what the platform would become. Little is known about the token, but OpenSea’s CMO Adam Hollander shared that the OpenSea Foundation would release more details in early October. (OpenSea and the OpenSea Foundation are two separate entities)\n\nIn this conversation with CoinDesk, Hollander discusses how the platform is expanding beyond NFTs, the long-delayed SEA token, and the challenge of keeping both longtime users and newcomers engaged in an increasingly crowded crypto market.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nCoinDesk: With the rebrand of OpenSea, who are you trying to compete with and where is this pivot heading?\n\nAdam Hollander: I would say we broadly want people to view OpenSea as their Web3 home, which means that you should be able to easily trade any type of asset across any chain or wallet extremely seamlessly and easily, regardless of your level of experience in crypto.\n\nSo if you are somebody that is in the trenches trading every day, then we have a lot of very robust features for you. And if you're somebody that doesn't have a lot of experience in crypto, then we're going to be building a lot of very easy to use seamless features to onboard you into crypto and make sure that you can experience what it's like to trade tokens, NFTs, other types of assets on-chain.\n\nSo if you are moving away from the NFT marketplace and include trading on the platform, what are some of those features you mentioned that will be available?\n\nWe are the world's largest NFT marketplace. We expect we will always be the world's largest NFT marketplace, and we care very deeply about that customer base and creators and artists and so we are not moving away from NFTs. We are evolving and expanding our platform so that it can be a single place where you can come and trade anything. Now the natural evolution of that over the last few months has been token trading, and so you can already come to OpenSea, and you can trade fungible tokens now across 22 chains extremely seamlessly\n\nBut we are building new features, literally, by the day.\n\nI wouldn't say that our vision is limited to just tokens and NFTs, there are a variety of really interesting things that people are doing now on-chain with real world assets and tokenization of things in the real world, anything from pokemon cards to real estate.\n\nAnd not to say that OpenSea has immediate plans in any one of these particular places, but we are viewing this as a single place that you can call your web3 home for virtually anything that you would be doing on-chain.\n\nGiven that NFT volume is not near the highs it once was, and given that the exchange market has become so saturated, how do you plan to keep up?\n\nThe volume today for NFTs is not what it was at the peak when, literally, Jimmy Fallon and presidents and everyone else were talking about NFTs every day. That being said, there were several billion dollars of volume in just Q1 of this year alone on NFTs. And so it is a vibrant market.\n\nWe are actually seeing significant upticks in that market over the course of the year. And when it comes to token trading and memecoins, and everything else that happens on-chain, outside of NFTs, there are hundreds of billions of dollars of volume that are happening in market, and OpenSea is seeing significant growth.\n\nSince we launched our new rewards program, we've seen almost 400% growth in volume just on OpenSea, and that's really exciting for us, because it means that we have built an incredible product.\n\nThe airdrop announcement came from the OpenSea Foundation 10 months ago. It hasn’t been released yet, so why have people been waiting so long?\n\nThe Foundation is releasing the token. I would likely challenge the assumption that tokens are supposed to be released quickly from the day that they're announced. There are lots of examples of tokens that have been hinted at or even formally announced and didn't actually come out for years subsequent and I would say there's no right or wrong way to do this, other than, of course, to validate that everybody wants it to happen immediately, because everybody's very excited about being rewarded for all of the time and energy and loyalty and volume that they drove through a site like OpenSea.\n\nI would simply say to you that it's very important for the OpenSea foundation that this is not a memecoin to be released and forgotten. If you look at the majority of coins to your example, they tend to go up into the right very quickly, and then they immediately go down into the right very quickly.\n\nAnd most of them, we're not really talking about anymore, and that's because they don't really serve a purpose. They weren't released for any particular reason other than the company decided, let's launch a token. And people are always excited about the opportunity to have free money dropped on their heads, but at the end of the day, what's important for us is that SEA token needs to be an integral part of the OpenSea ecosystem.\n\nWe are being very deliberate in our creative discussions with the foundation around ways that that can transpire, and a lot of what we're trying to do is innovative, and a lot of what the foundation is planning simply takes time.\n\nWe believe that we will release our token when the time is right to release it. That goes for what's right for OpenSea, what's right for the community, what's right for macro factors. There's a number of calculus that go into that. When we release it, we believe the market will appreciate that the foundation and OpenSea have been extremely thoughtful and deliberate about the way that this token should exist as a part of our ecosystem not as a memecoin to be released and forgotten, and hopefully as something that has a lot more staying power than the tokens people are used to seeing airdropped.\n\nThere has been some chatter online from OGs who may be angry at newcomers who might come onto the platform and find ways to get free money, while the OGs have stuck around for years might not get their fair share.\n\nHow do you balance bringing on new users on the platform and incentive them to stay on post airdrop while also keeping your original users engaged who may feel like the new folks are looking for ways to make fast money?\n\nWe of course, appreciate all of the historical users that have driven volume through OpenSea in the last seven to eight years, and we have a plan where we see those individuals, and the Foundation believes that it's going to be able to reward them appropriately.\n\nWe also as a business, need to have people continuously using the platform and leveraging it today as one of their main tools in crypto, and we also believe that we're going to be able to effectively reward people that are participating with our platform today and participating in our different phases of rewards. And so I would simply say that it does not serve OpenSea or the Foundation well to have entire cohorts of customers, whether it's our long-term most loyal customers upset, and it also does not serve us well to have people that are using the platform actively today upset.\n\nAnd so we have a number of plans in place that we think we're going to be able to do a very good job at rewarding everybody in an effective way. I can't speak to the details of that, other than to say, You know what we've said in our announcements, that if you've been on OpenSea for years and you've driven a lot of historical volume, we see you, you are not forgotten. And if you're using the platform today and you're participating in our rewards programs, then you will be meaningfully considered by the Foundation at TGE.\n\nRead more: OpenSea Teases SEA Token With Final Phase of Rewards Amid App Launch\n\nUPDATE (OCT 1., 18:10 UTC): Clarified that the OpenSea Foundation is in charge of the airdrop and that OpenSea is a separate entity, at the request of the OpenSea team.

    "title": "Bitcoin Heads into Historically Bullish October After Third-Best September On Record",
    "content": "Bitcoin closed September with a 5.16% gain, its third-best September on record since 2013, according to Coinglass data.\n\nThe performance comes as traders turn their attention to October, which has historically been the asset’s strongest month.\n\nSince 2013, bitcoin has averaged 14.4% gains in October, with a median return of 10.8%. Out of 13 Octobers in that span, 10 ended in the green and only three closed lower. That track record makes October the most statistically favorable month for the asset, with gains often clustering in the second half.\n\nSuch seasonality is a hallmark of financial markets, with markets tending to recede at the beginning of May before a spike in November. This is based on the belief that equity markets underperform during the summer due to lower trading volumes, reduced institutional activity, and historical returns data.\n\nHistorically, U.S. stock markets have shown weaker performance from May through October than from November through April, leading to the strategy becoming a seasonal rule-of-thumb for some investors.\n\nBitcoin also shows recurring seasonal patterns, often influenced by macro cycles, institutional flows, and retail sentiment. As such, past trading patterns show the first week of October can be choppy or negative, before stronger upside takes hold later in the month. In several years, bitcoin posted double-digit surges after Oct. 15, even when early price action was muted.\n\nThe backdrop this year is similar. Bitcoin’s mixed performance through 2025 — including drawdowns in spring and uneven summer trading — contrasts with the resilience of recent weeks, adding weight to the idea that September’s strength may be a precursor to late-year momentum.\n\nStill, seasonality offers probabilities, not certainties. Macro catalysts, from U.S. inflation prints to shifts in risk appetite, have historically shaped October’s rallies.\n\nBut with September’s performance ranking near the top and the odds favoring bulls in October, traders will be watching closely to see if history rhymes once again.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nThe financial industry loves to talk about speed. Real-time payments. Instant settlement. Same-day ACH. But making a horse-drawn carriage go faster doesn't turn it into a car. The problem with traditional financial settlement is that it was built for a world that no longer exists.\n\nTraditional financial infrastructure is a patchwork of batch processing systems, correspondent banking relationships and siloed databases that were state-of-the-art when telex machines roamed the earth. Even today's \"real-time\" payment rails are largely smoke and mirrors. They’re just faster messages layered on top of the same 1970’s architecture. They still require reconciliation, suffer from counterparty risk and depend on business hours in specific time zones.\n\nThis is a design problem. Consider what actually happens when a fintech promises \"instant\" international transfers. Behind the scenes, they're pre-funding accounts, managing float across multiple jurisdictions and hoping their reconciliation catches any discrepancies before month-end. The customer sees speed, but the company shoulders massive operational complexity and working capital requirements.\n\nSettlement friction negatively impacts every business that moves money. An e-commerce platform waiting T+2 for card settlements ties up working capital that could fund inventory. A logistics company managing international suppliers juggles dozens of banking relationships just to pay invoices. Even sophisticated enterprises with treasury management systems spend millions annually on the plumbing that moves value between entities.\n\nThis isn't sustainable in a world where digital commerce happens 24/7, supply chains span continents and customers expect Amazon-like efficiency from every interaction. Why do we have same-day delivery on a weekend for packages but not financial transfers?\n\nPublic blockchain infrastructure offers something that is worlds apart from traditional financial infrastructure: a shared, programmable settlement layer that operates continuously, transparently and without intermediaries. Value can move incredibly fast through a global economy built on blockchain rails.\n\nWhen BlackRock tokenized its BUIDL money market fund, it showed a recognition that 24/7 trading, near-instant settlement and programmable compliance create genuine operational advantages. When companies issue tokenized shares, they create a more efficient, transparent and accessible capital market infrastructure. These new financial primitives create entirely new markets.\n\nLet’s be clear that it’s not just financial services that are being revamped through better payment rails. The real unlock provided by smart contracts is that they can automate complex multi-party workflows that today require armies of back-office staff. A manufacturer can pay suppliers automatically when IoT sensors confirm delivery and quality checks. Real estate transactions can settle atomically, with payment, title transfer and regulatory filings happening simultaneously. Insurance claims can trigger instant payouts when parametric conditions are met.\n\nThe point, again, is that blockchain doesn't just digitize traditional finance or provide increased speed. Different rails mean entirely new business models are possible.\n\nEvery major bank is already tokenizing assets on Ethereum. Circle moves billions in USDC daily. PayPal's stablecoin runs on public blockchains. Why are any enterprises still debating whether this is \"real?\"\n\nThey're missing the plot. While traditional companies optimize their SWIFT messages and patch their core banking systems, an entire parallel financial system has emerged. The gig economy worker in Manila doesn't know or care that her USDC payment bypassed the correspondent banking network; she cares about whether the money arrived instantly, so that she can use it immediately to pay rent, buy groceries or send some home to her family, all without fees eating away at her paycheck.\n\nThe thing about infrastructure revolutions is that they don't announce themselves. In five years, \"we still use ACH\" will be the new \"we still host our own servers in-house.\" It’s technically possible, unnecessarily expensive, and a clear signal you've fallen behind.\n\nThe payment rails upgrade has happened. It just hasn't been evenly distributed yet.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nCoinDesk 20 Performance Update: Bitcoin (BTC) Rises 1%, Leading Index Higher\n\nAave (AAVE) was also a top performer, gaining 1% from Tuesday.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Ethereum’s next upgrade, Fusaka, just moved closer to going live on the main blockchain after a successful test run on the Holesky test network early Wednesday.\n\nThe Fusaka hard fork comes only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade and is designed to make things cheaper for institutions using Ethereum. One of the changes it introduces is PeerDAS, a feature that lets validators check only part of the data needed instead of full chunks (“blobs”), which helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators.\n\nTest networks like Holesky act as practice grounds where developers can safely test new code before it reaches the real chain. Holesky, launched in 2023, was particularly important because its validator setup closely mirrors Ethereum’s mainnet. But over the past few months, Holesky has started showing signs of age and reliability issues. Fusaka is the last upgrade the network will see before it shuts down — two weeks after Fusaka goes live on mainnet.\n\nThe next two testnet runs are scheduled for Oct. 14 and 28. After those are complete, Ethereum developers will lock in a date for Fusaka’s full mainnet launch.\n\n“Holesky finalized! A great first step towards Fusaka on mainnet and to more blobs on Ethereum,” said Ethereum Foundation DevOps engineer Parithosh Jayanthi on X.\n\nRead more: Ethereum to Close Its Largest Testnet, Holesky, After Fusaka Upgrade\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "XLM Surges 7% Before Swift Reversal as Bulls Face Profit-Taking",
    "content": "XLM posted a volatile trading session over the past 24 hours, surging from $0.36 to $0.39 before giving back gains in a sharp intraday reversal. The move represented a 7% advance as volumes spiked to 56.77 million—nearly double the 24-hour average—suggesting heightened institutional activity.\n\nThe most notable breakout occurred at 08:00 UTC on Oct. 1, when price accelerated from $0.37 to $0.38 on exceptional buying pressure, establishing firm support at the $0.37 level.\n\nMomentum carried through subsequent hours, with trading volumes exceeding 55 million during the 09:00 and 11:00 sessions. This consistent demand confirmed a shift in market structure, turning resistance near $0.38 into support while producing a string of higher lows that reinforced the bullish trend. Analysts often view this pattern as evidence of accumulation by larger players positioning ahead of key resistance levels.\n\nThat momentum, however, proved fleeting. During the final hour of the session, XLM retraced from $0.39 to $0.37 as profit-taking set in. The sharp selloff at 13:41 UTC, which drove prices down by two cents in under 30 minutes, erased much of the earlier gains and created a lower low that disrupted the prevailing uptrend. Institutional traders appeared to lock in profits following the rapid run-up, underscoring the fragility of recent bullish momentum.\n\nThe whipsaw session highlights the broader uncertainty weighing on cryptocurrency markets. While XLM briefly challenged the $0.40 psychological resistance, its swift rejection underscores ongoing volatility across digital assets amid macroeconomic headwinds. Traders will now be watching whether $0.37 can hold as a durable support zone—or if the breakdown signals further weakness ahead.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

Volume surged to 5.61 trillion tokens, far above the 1.89 trillion daily average, pushing the price through established resistance and holding above $0.000009600 by the close of the move.\n\nThe rally came amid a broader shift in the crypto market. The broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) has risen by more than 4.3% over the past 24-hour period.\n\nSome of the capital entering the market appears to have flowed into high-risk altcoins like PEPE and speculative presale projects, lifting prices across the memecoin space. The CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME) saw a near 5% rise in the same period.\n\nAccording to data from Nansen, PEPE’s price rally comes after whale accumulation took over in the last 30 days.

    "content": "Circle (CRCL), the crypto company known for its USDC stablecoin, introduced on Wednesday its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund offering to Solana, expanding its footprint to the blockchain known for low-cost transactions and fast settlement times.\n\nThe move expands the USYC token beyond Ethereum, Near, Base and Canton networks and the planned addition of BNB Chain.\n\nUSYC is a tokenized version of a short-duration U.S. government money market fund. The fund is redeemable in real time into USDC, Circle’s dollar-backed stablecoin, and is available only to non-U.S. institutional investors who pass know-your-customer (KYC) checks. That makes USYC permissioned by design, in contrast to other tokens commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe broader tokenized treasury market has seen explosive growth recently, swelling to nearly $8 billion today from $2.4 billion in a year, RWA.xyz data shows. That increase reflects the growing institutional appetite for real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchain rails, particularly yield-bearing government securities. They are increasingly used as collateral for lending and margin trading, or as a building block for other yield-generating strategies.\n\nWith a market cap of $635 million, USYC is the fifth-largest tokenized treasury fund, according to data from RWA.xyz.\n\nSolana’s integration adds new potential use cases, including using USYC as margin collateral for derivatives trading or as a yield-bearing asset in Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. However, USYC requires protocols to integrate eligibility checks and wallet allow-listing, a hurdle that many applications will need further development to support it.\n\nRead more: Republic to Tokenize Animoca Brands Equity on Solana to Broaden Investor Access\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "The Making of an Asset Class: Staking’s Next Chapter",
    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nNew asset classes don’t appear by decree — they emerge when size, volatility and diverse participants converge. When that happens, a set of risks and rewards becomes too important, too dynamic and too widely traded to ignore. That is the point at which investors stop treating it as a feature of the market and start recognizing it as an asset class.\n\nStaking is approaching that point.\n\nThe scale is undeniable. More than half a trillion dollars of assets are staked across proof-of-stake networks. Ethereum alone accounts for over $100 billion, while Solana, Avalanche and others add to the base. This is no longer experimental capital. It is large enough to support liquidity, professional strategies and eventually the kind of secondary products that only form when an ecosystem is deep.\n\nThe volatility is equally clear. Staking returns move in ways that matter. Solana’s rewards have ranged between 8% and 13% over the past year. Ethereum’s exit queues, a structural safeguard for network stability, have been stretched to weeks under current conditions as a major staking provider exited its validators. Slashing and downtime risks layer on idiosyncratic shocks. These frictions may frustrate investors, but they also create the conditions for risk premia, hedging tools and ultimately markets to emerge.\n\nAnd then there are the participants. What makes staking compelling is not just who is involved, but how their different objectives will push them into the market. ETPs and ETFs, bound by redemption schedules, need to manage staking exposure within defined liquidity windows. Digital asset treasuries will compete on net asset value, actively trading the staking reward term structure to beat benchmarks. Retail stakers and long-term holders will take the other side of liquidity, willing to sit through entry and exit queues for higher returns. Funds and speculators will take directional views on network activity and future reward levels, trading around protocol upgrades, validator dynamics or usage spikes.\n\nWhen these forces interact, they create price discovery. Over time, that is what will make markets efficient — and what will turn staking from a protocol function into a fully fledged asset class.\n\nThe trajectory is starting to resemble the path fixed income once took. Lending began as bilateral, illiquid agreements. Over time, contracts were standardized into bonds, risks got repackaged into tradable forms and secondary markets flourished. Staking today still feels closer to private lending: you delegate capital to a validator and wait. But the outlines of a market are forming — term-based products, derivatives on staking rewards, slashing insurance and secondary liquidity.\n\nFor allocators, this makes staking more than just a source of income. Its returns are driven by network usage, validator performance and protocol governance — dynamics distinct from crypto price beta. That opens the door to genuine diversification, and ultimately to a permanent role in institutional portfolios.\n\nStaking began as a technical function. It is becoming a financial market. And with size, volatility and participants already in place, it is now on the verge of something bigger: emerging as a true asset class.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nCoinDesk 20 Performance Update: Bitcoin (BTC) Rises 1%, Leading Index Higher\n\nAave (AAVE) was also a top performer, gaining 1% from Tuesday.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "The Protocol: Solana’s Firedancer Proposes Uncapping Block Compute-Unit Limit",
    "content": "This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nWelcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk.\n\nIn this issue:\n\nFIREDANCER DEVS PROPOSE REMOVING BLOCK-LEVEL COMPUTE UNIT LIMIT: In a bold shift for Solana’s scaling roadmap, Jump Crypto’s Firedancer development team has submitted a proposal, known as SIMD-0370, that would remove the block-level compute unit limit. The change, which the team suggested would be implemented following the deployment of the Alpenglow upgrade, could unlock a new regime of throughput by letting block producers have bigger blocks. Under today’s design, each block is bounded by a maximum allowable compute unit, a safety measure and maximum workload meant to stop validators from getting overwhelmed. Currently, the limit on Solana is at 60 million compute-units. Earlier this year, another group of Solana core developers submitted a paper arguing to lift the limit to 100 million compute-units. But with the upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, some developers say that cap is no longer necessary. And if that cap is lifted, blocks would be able to fit as many transactions as they can, depending on how high performing their validators are. Supporters say this flexibility could make Solana more resilient during periods of high demand, such as when new tokens launch or DeFi activity spikes. Bigger blocks would mean more transactions can get through, reducing the kinds of congestion and failed trades that frustrate users. Still, some debated that blocks today on Solana aren't full so there would be no tangible difference for end users. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nBITCOIN DEV DOUBLES DOWN ON DENIAL OF HARD FORK: Debates over Bitcoin’s future are nothing new, but this week the discussion took on a sharper edge. One of Bitcoin’s long-serving developers was at the center of a storm about immutability, censorship and what it means to “save” the protocol. The controversy escalated on Sept. 25, following an article published by The Rage claiming to reveal that Luke Dashjr, maintainer of the Bitcoin Knots software, advocated for a hard fork that would install a trusted multisig committee with power to retroactively alter the blockchain, review transactions and remove illicit content. A blockchain hard fork is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain software, requiring all participants to upgrade to the new protocol because the new and old versions are incompatible. The piece cited purported leaked text messages in which Dashjr allegedly warned: “Either Bitcoin dies or we have to trust someone.” The story spread across X, drawing hundreds of thousands of views and intensifying a long-running philosophical rift: should Bitcoin remain a neutral settlement layer, or should developers actively filter what counts as legitimate use of the network. Dashjr rejected the claims outright. “The truth is I have not proposed a hardfork or anything of the sort, and these bad actors are just grasping at straws to slander me and try to undermine my efforts to save Bitcoin again,” he wrote. The Rage responded with a meme to the effect of demanding to know who sent the leaked messages that its story shared. Dashjr repeated his position multiple times over the following 24 hours. “Nope, nothing changed. Nobody is calling for a hard fork still.\" he posted. In another reply, he underlined: “There is no hard fork.” — Jamie Crawley Read more.\n\nU.N. DABBLES IN BLOCKCHAIN: The United Nations leaned into blockchain technology to overhaul its own pension system, and a study of that process concluded the innovation is the \"ultimate technology for digital identity verification,\" which has spurred the UN toward extending the system and sharing it with other international groups. The UN — which has explored various blockchain uses over the years — tried it out on their United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), according to a white paper released this week that suggested its use in confirming people's identities can help in security, efficiency and transparency. In cooperation with the Hyperledger Foundation, the UN sought to \"improve and secure the UN pension process globally by putting a blockchain-supported digital identification infrastructure into production.\" The UN pension fund had been working off of a 70-year-old system to identify beneficiaries in 190 countries, relying on a paper-based approach to prove more than 70,000 beneficiaries were who they said they were, still alive and where they claimed to be. It was prone to error and abuse, and resulted in about 1,400 payment suspensions every year, according to the document. So the organization shifted to the blockchain-powered digital certification, beginning with a 2020 pilot program and a 2021 implementation. \"The shift away from physical documentation has substantially reduced processing times previously spent on receiving, opening, scanning, and archiving paper documents,\" the paper said. — Jesse Hamilton Read more.\n\nGATE ROLLS OUT TOKEN LAUNCHER: Crypto exchange Gate unveiled Gate Fun, an on-chain platform that allows users to issue and trade tokens without coding. The platform runs on Gate Layer, the company’s recently launched layer-2 network built on the OP Stack.

    "title": "Risks Ahead for Crypto in Q4 Even With Macro Tailwinds: Grayscale",
    "content": "The current crypto bull market has been powered by a combination of macro demand for scarce digital assets and growing regulatory clarity, two forces that are expected to continue to shape investor focus in the final quarter of 2025, asset manager Grayscale said in a report Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Grayscale, the Federal Reserve’s decision to resume rate cuts in September, and its signal that one or two additional cuts could follow before year-end, should generally be considered supportive for digital assets.\n\nLower borrowing costs, Grayscale noted, reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yield-bearing commodities such as bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,007.69\nand can encourage broader risk appetite across markets.\n\nAt the same time, the analysts cautioned that a slowing economy or escalating geopolitical risks could dampen valuations. They also highlighted the possibility that an unexpected Fed pivot back to rate hikes would pose a clear downside risk.\n\nOn the regulatory side, Grayscale pointed to several potential catalysts that could continue to draw investor attention. These include the introduction of staking within crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), the approval of new altcoin-based ETPs, and the potential passage of a market structure bill in the Senate.\n\nWhile each of these developments would represent meaningful progress, Grayscale warned that markets have already priced in a fair amount of optimism.\n\nAny setbacks, whether delays, political pushback, or outright rejection, could weigh on valuations, the report added.\n\nRead more: Crypto's Value Lies in Trillion-Dollar Markets, Bitwise Says\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

August’s originally reported 54,000 gain was revised to a loss of 3,000 jobs.\n\nTraders would typically be far more focused on the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report due Friday, but the release will likely be delayed due to the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the ISM September Manufacturing PMI Survey was in line at 49.1, but the Prices Paid index showed some welcome inflation news, dropping to 61.9 from 63.7 in August and forecasts for 63.2.\n\nIn equities, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were down slightly.

The CME FedWatch Tool shows 99% probability of a 25 basis point cut, up from 92% one week ago.\n\nSeptember has typically been a treacherous month for crypto, but little-noticed in the poor investor sentiment of late was bitcoin having one of its best Septembers in many years, gaining about 6% for the month.\n\nIn the final two days of September, the spot bitcoin ETFs gathered $950 million of inflows, more than reversing the $900 million of outflows the previous week.\n\n\"The next quarter is likely to see the start of the crypto bull market,\" said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. Her outlook is driven by incoming macro tailwinds in the form of interest rate easing and other potential policy support such as yield curve control being in the cards to keep markets steady if the global economy turns sour.\n\nThat environment should be positive for altcoins, too, she said, with new spot ETFs likely coming to market, turning investor attention to the sector. \"The coming quarter should bring the kickoff of 'alt-season', as attention starts to turn away from the 'majors' (BTC and ETH) and towards smaller, more volatile tokens.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The largest victim was one user who lost $6,500.\n\nBinance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao said that the exchange's security team is now tracking the funds and will reimburse victims in full.\n\nRather than panic, BNB’s community turned the incident into a joke, buying the scam token en masse and pumping it 500% in a show of defiance. CZ called it “the funniest comeback by the community,” helping reframe the hack as a display of resilience.\n\nBNB’s 1% rise is relatively small compared to the broader cryptocurrency market’s. As measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, the market rose 3.8% in the last 24 hours, after the U.S. government shutdown drove investors to alternative assets including BTC and gold.\n\nBNB traded in a wide $27 range between $993.23 and $1,021.03 across a 24-hour period. The session opened at $1,020.36 before dropping to a low of $993.23.\n\nThat move, roughly a 2.6% intraday dip, came with a spike in volume, with over 100,000 tokens traded in a single hour, double the daily average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.\n\nBuyers stepped in near the $993–$998 zone, absorbing the selling and lifting the price back above the $1,010 mark. Volumes have remained elevated, suggesting traders were defending short-term support around $1,010.\n\nThe stable close above $1,010, along with strong buying near $993, suggests buyers are willing to defend dips, especially as positive developments unfold around the chain.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

The final hour of trading saw another surge, with a high-volume push from $0.220 to $0.222, underscoring continued bullish momentum.\n\nThe gains come amid renewed institutional enthusiasm, with HBAR climbing roughly 4% over the past 24 hours. Hedera’s positioning has been reinforced by high-profile partnerships, including work with SWIFT, Citi, and Germany’s Bundesbank on interoperability frameworks.

    "content": "Strategy (MSTR) will post a profit for the second quarter in a row in the third quarter thanks to a rise in the price of bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,887.30\n. That would again qualify the company for potential S&P 500 inclusion.\n\nAccording to Jeff Walton, Chief Risk Officer of Strive, Strategy will have earned about $2.9 billion, or $10 per share thanks to bitcoin's move from about the $107,000 level to $114,000 at quarter's end. Over the past four quarters, MSTR will have earned roughly $22.80 per share.\n\nThe analysis factors in an estimated deferred tax liability of $970 million, leaving a net income estimated at $2.9 billion. The analysis concludes with an estimated trailing twelve-month earnings per share (EPS) of $22.8, reflecting positive EPS in Q2 and an estimated positive EPS in Q3 2025 ($32.6 and $10.1, respectively) which offset negative results in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025.\n\nWhile positive trailing twelve-month EPS is one requirement for S&P 500 inclusion, other criteria include a positive latest quarter, more than 50% public float, and average daily trading volume above 250,000 shares — all of which MSTR has. The S&P 500 committee, though, is under no requirement to add a company just because it meets those criteria.\n\nThe fourth quarter 2025 S&P 500 rebalancing is scheduled to take effect after the market closes on Dec. 19.\n\nBeyond potential S&P 500 inclusion, Strategy increased its dividend rate on its perpetual preferred stock STRC from 10% to 10.25% and declared cash dividends payable Oct. 31, with guidance that rates will be evaluated using the five-day VWAP of STRC prior to the final trading day of each month, according to analyst Ben Werkman. STRC currently priced at $97 (within the $95 to $98.99 band), this resulted in a 25 basis point increase, and Strategy has indicated it will continue raising the rate to bring STRC closer to its $100 par value.\n\nMSTR shares are higher by 2.9% premarket alongside a 3% rise in the price of bitcoin to $116,700.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Crypto Perp DEX Mania May Quickly Fizzle Out, BitMEX CEO Says",
    "content": "SINGAPORE — By the time Token2049 reconvenes next year, today’s headline‑grabbing decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid and Aster may no longer dominate, BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz told CoinDesk in an interview, warning that their incentive‑heavy business models are too fragile to endure.\n\nRecently, a competitive battle has erupted in the perpetual decentralized exchange (perp DEX) sector, with emerging platforms like Aster and Lighter significantly challenging Hyperliquid’s former dominance.\n\nLast week, Aster surpassed Hyperliquid in terms of 24-hour trading volume. This has sparked a race among competitors to launch new DEXs, aiming to capture market share in this expanding field.\n\nTake Justin Sun, for example, who announced the launch of a new DEX at the Token2049 conference in Singapore, signaling further intensification in this rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nThe excitement, however, is likely to be short-lived, according to Lutz, who claimed these types of DEXs as inherent pump-and-dump schemes.\n\n“DEXs are about giving access to markets without intermediaries, and they build momentum by relying heavily on incentives; it’s basically an inherent pump‑and‑dump scheme,” Lutz said, noting that “I don’t mean that in a bad way or as a scam. It’s all public, you know what you’re getting into.\"\n\nHe likened the incentive programs to an advertising blitz that pays for attention, explaining that these platforms hook users with token rewards and fee rebates and then depend on that feedback loop to keep people trading.\n\nWhile jumping into the next brand new idea is nothing new, the longevity of these ideas is a more important topic.\n\n\"The question is, what sticks?\" he continued.\n\nThis boom‑and‑bust cadence not only makes it hard for DEXs to retain liquidity over the long term, he added, it also means retail traders chasing outsized yields are exposing themselves to considerable volatility and risk.\n\nIn contrast to the churn he sees in DeFi, Lutz said the largest centralized exchanges, led by Coinbase and its peers, are well-positioned to ride out these cycles and remain dominant long after the latest DEX incentives subside.\n\nHe added that BitMEX’s goal is to straddle both worlds. While he views DeFi as enduring and personally embraces it as a crypto-native, Lutz noted that institutions can't interact with it in the same way they can with a centralized exchange.\n\nThe Japanese capital, not Hong Kong or Singapore, is where the trading volume is, according to Lutz.\n\nIn August, the exchange officially moved its data infrastructure to AWS Tokyo from AWS Dublin in a move aimed at boosting liquidity. The switch has delivered the desired results, underscoring Japan’s attractiveness.\n\n\"We were in Ireland before … but it became more and more difficult because basically everyone except the U.S. players are in the Tokyo data centers,\" he said.\n\nHe said the switch boosted liquidity by roughly 180% in BitMEX’s main contracts and up to 400% in some altcoin markets, gains he attributed not to market-maker intervention but to reducing latency by being in Tokyo.\n\nLutz predicts the next crypto cycle will look markedly different from prior booms and busts.\n\nWith greater institutional participation, he said, BTC could behave more like a “real asset,” smoothing out the dramatic peaks and troughs that have defined past runs.\n\n“I expect that with greater adoption we’ll see longer plateau phases than in previous cycles; the market will still follow the same rules and characteristics, but with lower volatility as it becomes a real asset embraced by the world’s wealthy,” he said.\n\nThe bitcoin market volatility has declined markedly since the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S. last year. Moreover, BTC’s implied volatility indices have steadily evolved into VIX-like structures, moving in the opposite direction of spot prices.\n\n'All this means that even though some of these new DEXs, offering eye-watering leverage – which Lutz believes won't last until next year – there aren't fireworks in store for BTC. Instead, it'll resemble any other sophisticated asset class, with gradual ups and downs as the market cycle progresses.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "CoinShares, the European digital asset manager with roughly $10 billion under management, said Wednesday it will acquire Financial Conduct Authority-regulated Bastion Asset Management.\n\nThe financial details of the deal, which is subject to UK regulatory approval, were not disclosed in press materials. The move is intended to deepen CoinShares’ capabilities in actively managed crypto strategies and support its U.S. expansion.\n\nLondon-based Bastion specializes in systematic investment strategies for digital assets. The firm has focused on market neutral and quantitative approaches aimed at institutional clients. Under the agreement, Bastion’s team, including CEO Philip Scott and CIO Fred Desobry, will join CoinShares.\n\nCoinShares is best known for its exchange-traded products, which give investors passive exposure to cryptocurrencies. Adding Bastion’s strategies will allow the firm to combine passive products with active management, creating what it says could be a more complete suite for investors. For example, a pension fund that currently uses CoinShares’ bitcoin ETPs might soon be able to allocate to a market-neutral crypto fund designed to smooth returns in volatile markets.\n\nThe acquisition also bolsters CoinShares’ U.S. ambitions. With an Investment Advisor license already in place, the company plans to launch actively managed funds tailored for institutional investors in the U.S., a market where regulatory clarity has made such products increasingly viable.\n\n“This acquisition perfectly aligns with our vision to provide our global investor base with comprehensive digital asset management solutions\" said Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO and Co-Founder of CoinShares. \"Having worked closely with Bastion over the course of the last year, we have experienced first-hand the performance of their strategies and witnessed their expertise in systematic digital asset investing.”\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Paxos Labs and the Aleo Network Foundation are working to launch a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin that aims to preserve user privacy, and appeal to financial institutions, the companies said.\n\nUnveiled on Wednesday, the USAD token was built on Aleo’s zero-knowledge (ZK) layer 1 blockchain and issued through Paxos Labs, an infrastructure provider that was incubated under Paxos, the firm behind popular stablecoins such as\nPYUSD\n$0.9999\nand the Global Dollar (USDG).\n\nStablecoins are a fast-growing class of cryptocurrencies that are increasingly considered as a cheaper, faster alternative for moving money globally. They are tokens with prices tied to fiat money like the U.S. dollar, and use blockchains to settle transactions. Interest in stablecoins has accelerated with U.S. President Donald Trump signing the GENIUS Act into law earlier this year, enacting federal standards for stablecoin issuers.\n\nUnlike conventional stablecoins such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, Aleo's stablecoin encrypts wallet addresses and transaction amounts, shielding them from public view.\n\nThat design could appeal to financial institutions wary of exposing sensitive transactions data on-chain.\n\n\"Stablecoins have proven to be one of the most powerful innovations in financial markets, and we are only scratching the surface,\" said Bhau Kotecha of Paxos Labs in a statement. USAD aims to \"bring digital dollars into a new era where enterprises can embed money that is private, programmable and trusted from the ground up,\" he added.\n\nThe new token fits into The Aleo Network Foundation's focus of developing cryptographic tools that allow for programmable transfers without revealing counterparties. The project drew venture capital backing from a16z, Coinbase Ventures and SoftBank among others.\n\n\"Privacy is the missing link in blockchain adoption at scale, and with USAD we are proving it can exist in a programmable stablecoin,\" said Leena Im, chief operating officer at The Aleo Network Foundation. \"By pairing Aleo’s technology with Paxos Labs’ issuance stack, we are taking a joint, front-door approach with enterprises to show that digital dollars can be both trusted and transparent to oversight while protecting user confidentiality.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$122,899.10\nmoved higher amid the U.S. government shutdown and its up roughly 3% in the last 24 hours to $116,400. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 index (CD20) rose 3.5%.\n\nEquities markets excluding the U.S. also moved higher, even as traders remain cautious over the shutdown. Europe’s STOXX 50 is up 0.3% in today’s session, while the FTSE 100 rose 0.7%. Futures on the S&P 500 are, however, down 0.55% while on the Nasdaq they’re down 0.64%.\n\nThe U.S. government shutdown could lead to economic data delays, which are compounded by looming tariffs on various items. This has seemingly seen investors move away from the country and into alternative stores of value.\n\nThat uncertainty has seen the price of gold rise 3.75% in the past week to now hover around $3,890 per ounce. Spot crypto ETFs drew in more than $550 million in net inflows on Sept. 30, with spot bitcoin ETFs representing the lion’s share of that figure.\n\nThe flight to alternative assets is occurring against a favorable macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep cutting interest rates this month, with Polymarket traders weighing an 85% chance of a 25 bps cut. That figure is near 95% in the CME’s Fedwatch tool. Lower interest rates could make risk assets, which include cryptocurrencies, more appetizing for investors.\n\nInstitutional involvement has also deepened amid the changing monetary policy. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) overtook Deribit to become the top venue for bitcoin options trading by open interest, now near $38 billion.\n\n“We have seen the convergence of both institutional backing and maturation across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is more embedded in the foundations of global finance, and institutional interest is at an all-time high,” Dom Harz, co-foudner of Bitcoin DeFi gateway BOB, told CoinDesk.\n\n“Unlike previous years, this Uptober will see more targeted inflows, which could be a breakout moment in accelerating Bitcoin DeFi, as investors will want to do more with their Bitcoin holdings; transforming it from a static store-of-value into a yield-bearing asset class,” he added.\n\nIndeed, bitcoin exposure coupled with yield appears to be becoming a new trend. Just this morning Swiss digital bank Sygnym launched a new BTC Alpha Fund, aiming to generate yield on bitcoin without reducing exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price movements.\n\nWhile traditional markets are likely to see lower volatility due the upcoming data vacuum from the government shutdown, crypto market see a wave of spot ETF decisions in the near future to look forward to.\n\nThe SEC is scheduled to make decisions on a total of 16 spot crypto ETF applications this month. Stay alert!\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's week-ahead note.\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's week-ahead note.\n\nFor a more comprehensive list of events this week, see CoinDesk's week-ahead note.\n\nBy Oliver Knight\n\nCrypto Treasury Companies\n\nSpot BTC ETFs\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors\n\nMore For You\n\nGold's Historic Run Dwarfs BTC But Analyst Remains Positive: Crypto Daybook Americas\n\nYour day-ahead look for Oct. 8, 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day.

    "title": "Crypto's Value Lies in Trillion-Dollar Markets, Bitwise Says",
    "content": "Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said crypto’s critics often miss the scale of what’s at stake, in a report published Monday.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,081.56\n, with a $2.3 trillion market value, is often compared to Amazon (AMZN), Hougan noted.\n\nBut while Amazon’s worth comes from the fact that it’s used by millions every day, bitcoin’s value stems from the market it’s competing with: gold, a $25 trillion asset, the report said. Capturing less than 10% of gold’s share would justify bitcoin’s current valuation. By contrast, a startup trying to replace Amazon would need to take over its entire market.\n\nThe same dynamic applies to Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains, Bitwise said, which are positioning themselves to handle payments, settlement and tokenized assets.\n\nThe report noted that the global payments industry processes $1.8 quadrillion annually, while the combined value of stocks, bonds and real estate is estimated at $665 trillion.\n\nThose kinds of numbers explain why ether trades at around $500 billion and solana near $100 billion. Unlike centralized companies, decentralized platforms can credibly capture pieces of such vast markets, argued Hougan.\n\nHougan also points to Tether, reportedly exploring a $500 billion valuation. At first glance, comparing Tether to companies like OpenAI or SpaceX seems implausible. But Tether already dominates stablecoin use in emerging markets, and if adoption grows to the point where USDT replaces local currencies in some countries, its assets could run into the trillions. At that scale, Tether could surpass even Saudi Aramco’s record $120 billion in annual profits.\n\nFor investors, the lesson is that crypto isn’t chasing small opportunities, it’s taking aim at some of the largest addressable markets in the world, the report added.\n\nRead more: Ether Treasuries Are Going Mainstream: Crypto Investment Firm Bitwise\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Traders Eye September Jobs Report for Cues on Bitcoin Breakout Above $120K",
    "content": "Crypto markets remained unchanged Monday and Tuesday after last week’s $1.5 billion liquidation flush, but traders remain cautious ahead of a critical run of U.S. economic data that could set the tone for October.\n\nBitcoin bulls defended the $110,000 support level several times over the past week, while Ether clawed back from a sharp dip to $4,075 that coincided with nearly half a billion dollars in leveraged longs being wiped out.\n\nTotal market capitalization now sits near $3.85 trillion, about 1.3% lower than a week earlier despite a 3.5% weekend rebound.\n\nThe Fed’s most recent rate cut initially provided a modest boost to Bitcoin, but investors say the path forward depends less on past easing than on Powell’s Tuesday speech and upcoming jobs data that is scheduled to be released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. (ET).\n\n“The crypto market is at a macroeconomic crossroads, caught between a softening labor market and resilient economic growth,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a message to CoinDesk.\n\n“This week’s data — Consumer Confidence, Initial Jobless Claims, and the pivotal September Jobs Report — will be critical in gauging the Fed’s next move. Any signs of further labor market cooling could reignite rate cut expectations, providing a tailwind for majors like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Conversely, strong data may extend the current period of uncertainty and pressure,” he said.\n\nJobs data shows how many people are getting or losing work in the U.S. economy. If fewer people are working and unemployment rises, it suggests the economy is slowing.\n\nThat usually makes the Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates to support growth, which can boost risk assets like stocks and crypto. But if job numbers are strong and unemployment stays low, it signals the economy is still running hot. That can keep inflation high, making the Fed less likely to cut rates.\n\n“This macro uncertainty is likely to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially capping the upside for Ethereum and the broader DeFi sector despite their superior yield opportunities,” Ruck added.\n\nMarket structure reflects the indecision. A guage for sentiment fell to 28 on Friday, entering “extreme fear,” before bouncing back to a neutral 50 by Monday. Bitcoin has consolidated in a tight $108,000–$118,000 range, with open interest compressed and funding rates normalized after the liquidations.\n\n“The rebound is coming from roughly the same levels as in early September,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. “Once again, altcoins are recovering stronger than BTC. Such outperformance in the early stages of recovery often indicates the future winners of the race, which in this case are altcoins.”\n\nKuptsikevich noted Bitcoin’s technical levels remain pivotal: “At the end of last week, Bitcoin found support at 109,000. It was bought at roughly the same levels as the end of August and even slightly higher, which is positive for the bulls.”\n\n“On the other hand, September's local high is lower than the previous one, which generally indicates a decrease in volatility and a stronger movement towards a breakout beyond the $108-118K range. Movements within the range can give many false short-term signals,” he noted.\n\nEthereum faces its own inflection point. Analysts flagged a potential bottom, citing technical exhaustion after last week’s selloff. The token is also in focus after the launch of the first U.S. ETF with staking features, from REX Shares and Osprey Funds, with applications from BlackRock and Fidelity still under SEC review.\n\nNews around Solana added to the altcoin narrative. The network’s total value locked surged to $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, prompting fresh calls for a $300 price target. Meme coins have grown more prominent as well, with sector capitalization climbing 70% over three months.\n\nRegulatory headlines, however, kept traders wary. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are probing potential insider trading tied to companies accumulating crypto reserves.\nElsewhere, ratings giant Moody’s separately warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoin use in developing countries poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "XRP Futures See Institutional Adoption, Solana Futures Hit $1B OI in 5 Months, Outpacing Bitcoin and Ether: CME Group",
    "content": "SINGAPORE – Institutional investors are quickly embracing CME’s futures for\nXRP\n$2.8828\nand solana\nSOL\n$222.74\n, both launched earlier this year, alongside steady growth in bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,899.10\nand ether\nETH\n$4,504.02\nderivatives, according to Tim McCourt, the exchange’s Global Head of Equity & FX Products.\n\nSpeaking at the ongoing Token2049 conference attended by CoinDesk, McCourt stated that total crypto futures open interest, a key indicator of institutional activity, has doubled year-over-year, now reaching $30 to $35 billion daily. Importantly, this growth isn’t driven solely by bitcoin.\n\nCME’s cash-settled futures have long served as a go-to for institutions wanting exposure to cryptocurrencies through regulated products, without having to own the tokens directly.\nFutures contracts are standardized, legally binding agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a set price on a specific future date. Open interest refers to the number of active contracts at any one time, often expressed in dollar value.\n\n\"When we look at the new futures that we recently introduced this year, XRP and SOL, they are also enjoying institutional adoption, with open interest at record highs,\" McCourt said during the panel \", Institutional Flows Into Digital Assets.\"\n\nThe standard solana futures contract, sized at 500 SOL, debuted in mid-March and crossed the $1 billion notional open interest mark in August. Futures tied to the payments-focused XRP crossed that threshold in August, just three months after they began trading with a standard contract size of 50,000 XRP.\n\n\"The speed at which solana is accumulating open interest is really interesting. SOL took about five months to hit the one billion [OI] mark, compared to ether, which took about eight months. Meanwhile, BTC took three years,\" McCourt said.\n\nHe also took note of the record activity in both ether futures and options. As of Tuesday, open interest in ether futures contract, sized at 50 ETH, stood at $9.05 billion, having hit a lifetime peak of $10.42 billion in August.\nEther futures began trading on the CME in early 2021. Open interest in ether options also hit a record high of over $1 billion in September.\n\n\"While crypto is hot, certainly ether is hot at the CME. We see record open interest, record trading volume, both in standard and micro size contracts,\" McCourt noted.\n\nThe availability of regulated crypto futures, along with the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S., has brought greater legitimacy and transparency to the market, attracting more institutional capital and increasing overall market liquidity.\n\nCME's cash-settled futures enable large investors to hedge risks, speculate, and establish arbitrage plays, effectively managing their net exposure.\n\nThese futures, therefore, contribute to price discovery, reduce volatility through an orderly trading mechanism, and pave the way for the broader adoption of digital assets within traditional markets.\n\nThe panel also included a discussion on the impact of ETFs and stablecoins, featuring insights from Binance CEO Richard Teng, Bitwise Asset Management CEO Hunter Horsley, and Heath Tarbert, president of Circle, the issuer of USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin.\n\nTarbert said that stablecoins are ideal partners for traditional banks, emphasizing the importance of legal and regulatory clarity.\nHe added that stablecoins like USDC can help banks integrate and offer tokenized versions of their lending products, stressing that these dollar-pegged tokens are not competitors to banks but pathways to create new financial products.\n\nHorsley said that 2025 marks the beginning of the mainstream era for crypto while Teng highlighted different waves of institutional interest.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "SEC's Bow to DoubleZero Carries Major Weight for Decentralized Infrastructure: Peirce",
    "content": "Even before the arrival of President Donald Trump and his crypto-friendly regulators, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had a crypto advocate, Commissioner Hester Peirce, who contends that a decision this week to grant DoubleZero a so-called no-action letter represents the kind of space she's long been wanting to offer blockchain pursuits.\n\nThe SEC staff agreed to the startup's request that the agency wouldn't pursue any registration complaints for tokens issued for the specific aims of DoubleZero's decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN). Commissioner Peirce suggested this open door for DePIN efforts keeps the SEC out of business it shouldn't be in.\n\n\"Rather than relying on centralized corporate structures to coordinate activity, DePIN projects enlist participants to provide real-world capabilities, such as storage, telecommunications bandwidth, mapping, or energy, through open and distributed peer-to-peer networks,\" she said in a statement. The activity doesn't trigger the Supreme Court's Howey Test — the test that decides what falls within the SEC's jurisdiction — because such projects \"allocate tokens as compensation for work performed or services rendered, rather than as investments with an expectation of profit from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.\"\n\nThe SEC uses no-action letters to make it clear what activities it doesn't intend to pursue with enforcement actions, so a letter to a single firm can signal to an entire space what the agency's current posture is. But to reap the benefits, the activity has to stay strictly within the boundaries outlined in the SEC's letter.\n\n\"The line between tokens and securities law is getting clearer,\" said Austin Federa, DoubleZero co-founder, in a statement to CoinDesk. \"Founders who once spent countless hours (and legal dollars) on this question can now focus on building.\"\n\nDoubleZero sought to incentivize providers of infrastructure for network connectivity, such as large technology companies that control surplus fiber networks, by compensating them with tokens — in this case, the protocol's native 2Z.\n\n\"Treating such tokens as securities would suppress the growth of networks of distributed providers of services,\" Peirce said. \"Blockchain technology cannot reach its full potential if we force all activities into existing financial market regulatory frameworks.\"\n\nThe agency's action drew praise from advocates of decentralized finance (DeFi).\"No-Action Letters are one of the most pragmatic tools for navigating regulatory uncertainty in crypto, and the SEC's issuance of No-Action Letters shows that constructive engagement with regulators is possible,” said Amanda Tuminelli, executive director of the DeFi Education Fund, in a blog posting by the DoubleZero Foundation.\n\nThe SEC has been pursuing an aggressive course of pro-crypto policy actions under Chairman Paul Atkins. Earlier this week, he said at a roundtable event in the agency's Washington headquarters that establishing clear rules for the digital assets sector is \"job one\" for the SEC. Before Atkins arrived, Peirce led the agency's crypto task force and was already working on policy statements to clarify the regulator's expectations for the industry.\n\nRead More: DoubleZero's 'New Internet' for Blockchains Nabs $400M Valuation from Top Crypto VCs\n\nMore For You\n\nState of Crypto: What Happens to Crypto if Government Shutdown Lingers\n\nA short-term shutdown probably won't hurt crypto's efforts in D.C. much.

    "content": "Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR token slipped nearly 3% in the 24 hours through September 30, falling from $0.22 to $0.21 as institutional investors pared back exposure to enterprise-focused cryptocurrencies. The decline came after HBAR met resistance at the $0.22 level during evening trading on September 29, with volumes climbing above 34 million tokens as corporate holders began to take profits.\n\nMarket participants said support around the $0.21 threshold initially held through the morning of September 30, but heavy selling in the afternoon pushed volumes sharply higher, peaking at nearly 55 million tokens in the final hour of trading. Analysts suggested that the move reflected growing caution among corporate treasuries in the wake of evolving regulatory frameworks for enterprise blockchain adoption.\n\nBy late afternoon on September 30, HBAR briefly recovered before slipping again to intraday lows around $0.21. Elevated trading activity during the final hour—topping 5.9 million tokens in a single interval—highlighted the intensity of institutional rebalancing. The token ended the session with modest stabilization near $0.21, but market watchers warned continued volatility may persist as corporate strategies adapt to shifting regulatory headwinds.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "Coinbase (COIN) said its bitcoin-backed loan program has surpassed $1 billion in originations since launching in January, underscoring growing demand for crypto as collateral.\n\nThe exchange currently offers retail customers in the U.S. the ability to borrow cash against bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,696.30\nholdings through the on-chain Morpho platform. A spokesperson said the average loan size sits at $54,000 but noted the firm plans to raise its borrowing cap from $1 million to $5 million in the coming weeks.\n\n“We do see some users borrowing up against the current $1 [million] loan limit, and are excited to meet their needs, as well,” the spokesperson said. “We work closely with the Morpho team to ensure that we maintain steady liquidity in the onchain loan protocol as we roll out to more customers with larger loans.”\n\nThe product caters to customers looking to access cash without selling their bitcoin, a use case that mirrors how homeowners tap equity or how businesses leverage equipment. Coinbase said top applications include debt consolidation, covering large unexpected expenses such as medical bills or taxes, investing in real estate, and making high-cost purchases.\n\nThe move comes as the asset-based lending industry continues to expand. A July report projected the market could reach $1.3 trillion by 2030, reflecting broader interest in loans secured by assets beyond traditional real estate or vehicles.\n\nBy pushing the ceiling higher, Coinbase is positioning itself to serve wealthier clients and investors who may want to borrow against larger bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe milestone highlights the steady integration of crypto into conventional financial practices.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

He said the decision will allow him to spend more time with family while staying active in the XRP community.\n\n“I’m not going away from the XRP community. You haven’t seen the last of me (now, or ever),” he posted. “The last few months I’ve been tinkering on the side – spinning up my own XRPL node and publishing its output data, researching other use cases for XRP (besides what Ripple is focused on), and more.”“I truly enjoy this part — getting my hands dirty, talking to builders, coding for the pure love of it — and I’m really excited to get back to that. More to come on this very soon, I’m sure<” Schwartz added.Ripple confirmed that Dennis Jarosch, the firm’s senior vice president of engineering, will lead technical operations going forward.\n\nSchwartz joined Ripple in 2011 as a cryptographer, helping design the ledger that underpins XRP transactions. He was promoted to CTO in 2018 and has since become one of the most recognizable voices in the XRP community, defending the ledger’s role against critics and guiding its evolution through regulatory battles and technical upgrades.\n\nThe leadership shuffle comes as Ripple positions RLUSD, its stablecoin, deeper into tokenized treasury markets and expands the XRP Ledger’s use cases beyond payments.\n\nXRP was last trading at $2.84, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The decline came within a narrow $0.01 range, underscoring the token’s struggle to sustain momentum. Early resistance at $0.38, coupled with heavy trading volume of 38.6 million, signaled strong institutional selling, while a secondary rejection at the same level, with 18.6 million in volume, reinforced the bearish sentiment.\n\nSupport emerged at $0.37 and $0.36, with the latter drawing considerable defensive buying late in the session as volumes spiked to 31.4 million. While the high-volume activity at $0.36 hints at accumulation, the broader market structure—defined by lower highs and lows—suggests the bearish bias remains intact. Breaching the psychological $0.37 threshold further cemented the case for extended downside pressure.\n\nXLM closed the 24-hour period with a failed recovery attempt at $0.37 in its final hour of trading, where volumes briefly surged before being rejected, sealing a 4% cumulative decline.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

Transactions spiked well above the daily average of 6.9 million on two occasions, suggesting coordinated exits by large holders.\n\nThe pressure comes as SUI Corporation begins a $143.9 million token unlock, releasing 44 million tokens between Sept. 29 and Oct. 6. This is one of the largest scheduled distributions in a week, which will see more than $773 million worth of cryptocurrency vesting events. Similar unlocks from projects like Ethena ($126.8 million), Eigen ($68.6 million), and Optimism ($21.3 million) are weighing on sentiment across the sector.\n\nFor traders, the concern is twofold: technical weakness and fresh supply. Even if demand stays flat, the extra supply can pressure prices lower, forcing difficult allocation decisions.\n\nWith altcoins broadly under pressure, the next test for SUI will be whether buyers defend the $3.20 level or allow further downside as the unlock cycle continues.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "SINGAPORE — Arf, a Swiss provider of short-term liquidity for cross-border payments, is set to join Circle Payments Network (CPN) in a move that will provide eligible users access to on-demand credit, effectively eliminating the need for prefunding, or tying up a large fiat balance before settlement occurs.\n\nThe integration, powered by Huma Finance's PayFi network, aims to make cross-border stablecoin settlements faster and more capital-efficient, said Irfan Ganchi, senior vice president of product management at Circle Internet (CRCL). Circle is the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap.\n\nThe development addresses a fundamental challenge in cross-border finance — how to move money quickly across borders without locking up large amounts of capital in prefunding, which limits flexibility and increases costs. Payments giant Visa (V) is also working on the problem and is starting a prefunding pilot for the use of stablecoins through Visa Direct, its real-time payments platform, it said Tuesday.\n\nBy enabling on-demand credit inside a major stablecoin network, Arf, which is regulated by Switzerland's Financial Services Standard Association (VQF), and Huma are facilitating same-day USDC settlement, helping institutions free up working capital, reduce costs and accelerate payments, Ganchi said at the Circle Forum in Singapore.\n\nReal-time stablecoin payments and reducing prefunding hurdles have been longstanding goals in the crypto and fintech industries. However, this partnership stands out as one of the prominent ones to include regulated entities and offer direct integration into a major stablecoin network, such as CPN.\n\nUSDC holds a market value of $73.26 billion. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, USDC operates within regulated frameworks, offering greater reliability and trust.\n\nThe adoption of stablecoins in cross-border transactions and other user cases beyond trading has been steadily growing.\n\nAccording to Payments Consulting Network, 90% of financial institutions have actively integrated stablecoins, with nearly half already using them for payments. Traditional banks are twice as likely to prioritize cross-border payments, with 58% using stablecoins specifically for international transfers.\n\nAccording to Treasury & Risk, the overall market for stablecoins is poised to hit $3 trillion by 2028.\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The White House withdrew former Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner Brian Quintenz's nomination to run the agency late Tuesday, capping off a month-long fight over U.S. President Donald Trump's pick for agency chair.\n\nTrump tapped Quintenz shortly after retaking office. Quintenz joined venture firm Andresseen Horowitz's global head of policy, and has been an adviser to firms like prediction marketplace Kalshi since leaving the CFTC following his term as commissioner.\n\nIn a statement to CoinDesk, Quintenz said, \"Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the President for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I [am] looking forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.\"\n\nPolitico and Punchbowl News earlier reported that the White House had withdrawn Quintenz's nomination.\n\nQuintenz has made statements in favor of the crypto industry since his first term as commissioner, including floating the idea of a self-regulatory organization for the industry similar to securities markets' Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Despite this, crypto exchange Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — both of whom support Trump — opposed his nomination in late July, with Tyler telling CoinDesk that he did not believe Quintenz's views on developers and his work with Kalshi qualified him for the role.\n\nHowever, Quintenz released messages he had exchanged with the Winklevoss brothers earlier this month, suggesting that they really opposed his nomination because he would not commit to a public view on a CFTC enforcement action against Gemini. In his messages, Quintenz said that it would be better for a \"fully confirmed chair\" to review the CFTC's actions.\n\nCrypto lobbyist organizations and companies wrote a public letter supporting his nomination in a late August bid to put his nomination back on track.\n\nStill, the White House asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to postpone a vote on Quintenz's nomination a few times in July. Last week, Semafor reported that it had begun vetting new candidates to run the agency, which at present is helmed by Acting Chairman Caroline Pham. All of the other commissioners at the agency at the start of 2025 have since left, and Pham has indicated her intention to depart as well at some point, CoinDesk previously reported.\n\nThe CFTC's potential lack of a permanent chair comes as Congress considers legislation that would give the agency a more prominent role in regulating crypto spot markets, though the legislative process is likely to be delayed by a pending government shutdown.\n\nUPDATE (Sept. 30, 2025, 23:48 UTC): Adds additional context, clarifies that Quintenz joined a16z following his term as CFTC commissioner.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum has launched a new investment vehicle designed to generate yield on Bitcoin without reducing investors’ exposure to its price movements.\n\nThe BTC Alpha Fund, developed in partnership with Athens-based Starboard Digital, uses arbitrage strategies to target net annual returns of 8%-10%, which are paid directly in Bitcoin.\n\nThe fund is domiciled in the Cayman Islands and caters to professional and institutional investors. By converting arbitrage gains into bitcoin, participants can increase the number of coins they hold while still benefiting from bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation. Sygnum said the product has already drawn strong interest from clients looking for institutional-grade yield options in digital assets.\n\nThe fund comes as institutional investors are looking to go beyond just holding bitcoin in their portfolio and use decentralized finance (DeFi) to generate more income from their BTC holdings. The bitcoin DeFi has gained popularity and has the potential to open up a massive market, according to analysts.\n\nRecently, Binance research noted that only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, implying a potential for a large \"untapped opportunity.\" In fact, last year, Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said the opportunity could be as much as $1 trillion.\n\n\"Bitcoin has become a key exposure in modern portfolios, and many of our clients want to stay invested while building their positions further,\" said Markus Hämmerli, who is leading the BTC Alpha Fund offering at Sygnum.\n\nFor investors, one practical feature is that shares in the new fund can be pledged as collateral for U.S. dollar Lombard loans at Sygnum. This setup allows long-term bitcoin holders to unlock liquidity for other investments without selling down their crypto exposure.\n\nMonthly liquidity and a strict risk management framework are intended to give the fund flexibility while addressing volatility in digital markets. The partnership also leverages Starboard Digital’s background in trading and risk management.\n\nSygnum has been expanding its bitcoin offerings since launching various initiatives last year. The new fund adds to its growing suite of regulated products aimed at bridging traditional finance and the crypto economy.\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Investment platform Republic revealed plans on Tuesday to tokenize shares of crypto venture firm Animoca Brands on the Solana\nSOL\n$201.48\nblockchain, a move aimed at opening investor access through blockchain rails.\n\nAnimoca Brands, known for backing over 600 blockchain startups and projects, remains privately held with shares only traded in limited over-the-counter deals. Republic said its plan will create digital tokens that represent ownership in the company, which can be held in crypto wallets and traded on Republic’s own marketplace.\n\n\"This tokenization aligns strongly with Animoca Brands’ position as a Web3 leader, providing novel options for investors to tokenize and trade their holdings as well as broaden investment accessibility for a wider market,\" said Yat Siu, executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands.\n\nThe move could allow a wider, global set of investors to gain exposure to a private tech company without waiting for a traditional public listing. Tokenization, a red-hot trend to create blockchain-based tokens of traditional financial assets such as equity, is often touted as a tool for broadening investor access to assets previously limited to only a select few, proponents say. However, some private equity token offerings such as Robinhood's drew concerns such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulations.\n\nRepublic said Animoca's equity token will comply with existing regulatory requirements. Details on token pricing and launch timelines are expected later, the blog post said.\n\n\"This is a glimpse of the future, where retail investors worldwide can participate in opportunities once reserved for a few, and companies can tap into liquidity and distribution on a global scale,\" Solana Foundation president Lily Liu said in a statement.\n\nRead more: SEC Willing to Engage With Tokenized Asset Issuers, SEC’s Hester Peirce Says\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "U.S. SEC Takes Preliminary Step to Expand Universe of Crypto Custody to State Trusts",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has cracked the door to welcome crypto custody at a wide range of firms who've earned state charters as trust companies — a list that would include the trust affiliates of Coinbase, Kraken and other high-profile names in crypto.\n\nThe SEC's Division of Investment Management issued a so-called no-action letter on Tuesday, a document that assures that the regulator doesn't intend to pursue any enforcement actions by those engaging in the specific activity — in this case, that SEC-registered advisers and funds can park digital assets in state trusts.\n\nSuch qualified-custodian questions had represented a policy battleground during the tenure of former SEC chairs Gary Gensler and Jay Clayton, the former having led the agency to introduce a later-abandoned proposal that would have constrained what kinds of companies could handle the crypto of regulated investment advisers. Gensler made it clear he specifically meant to muscle out exchanges such as Coinbase.\n\nBut the SEC's new management — most notably Chairman Paul Atkins — is pursuing a crypto-forward campaign, with Atkins saying earlier this week that establishing industry policies is the agency's top priority (as assigned by pro-crypto President Donald Trump).\n\nWhile Tuesday's no-action letter isn't a formal agency rule, it carries enough weight to free firms from short-term compliance worries. Specifically, the document said the SEC \"would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under the custody provisions against a registered adviser or regulated fund for treating a state trust company as a 'bank' with respect to the placement and maintenance of crypto assets.\"\n\nThe earlier argument from Gensler was that crypto firms weren't safe and sufficiently regulated to qualify as risk-free enough for registered investment advisers to keep their customers' assets.\n\n\"Even though it was never adopted, the proposal has created problems for investment advisers through its assertion that most crypto assets are likely to be funds or crypto asset securities covered by the current rule, and thus must be maintained with a qualified custodian,\" Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech in Singapore on Tuesday.\n\nShe argued that the agency \"should consider updating the rules governing permissible custodians for registered investment advisers and investment companies,\" adding that maybe technologically adept companies should be permitted to custody assets themselves.\n\nBut Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who was allied with Gensler on this point two years ago, issued a statement opposing the no-action treatment, saying the SEC is effectively treating crypto as something apart from the rest of the financial sector. And it's ignoring the efforts of firms pursuing federal chartering from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\n\"Rather than create a level playing field, we leave investors and the markets to gamble in an unnecessary game of 50-state regulatory roulette – just to accommodate crypto,\" she said. \"Executing a shift of this magnitude via no-action relief without public comment and without any economic analysis is ill-advised for many reasons, not least of which because it likely violates the Administrative Procedure Act, though this has become commonplace by this commission.\"\n\nThe SEC has been pursuing a number of crypto policies under Atkin's recent Project Crypto, and the chairman has set an agenda to issue formal crypto rules in the coming months. Meanwhile, Congress has made extensive progress on legislation to more completely regulate the U.S. digital assets markets.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

JB Mackenzie, vice president and general manager of futures and international at the company, said users abroad have shown particular interest in this new form of trading.\n\n“We’re definitely looking to offer it globally, and my goal or focus is to make sure it’s a regulatory-compliant product everywhere we go,” Mackenzie told Bloomberg.\n\nTo that end, Robinhood has begun discussions with overseas regulators, including the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, to explore how a localized version of the product could be structured, he said.\n\nThe move follows its recent partnership with blockchain-based and CFTC-regulated Kalshi, which lets users bet on the outcomes of real-world events such as elections, economic data releases or geopolitical developments.\n\nThe push into prediction markets comes amid a surge of interest in event-based trading, sparked in part by the rise of crypto-native platform Polymarket. That platform has processed billions of dollars in wagers in 2024, largely tied to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe platform became so popular that Polymarket was recently reported to be weighing a potential deal that valued the company at $9 billion, a sharp climb from its $1 billion valuation just a few months ago.\n\nWhile Polymarket rose to fame, the market was somewhat constricted.

Rather than routing through sportsbooks, these trades are executed on Kalshi’s federally regulated exchange and treated like commodities, not wagers.\n\n\"Unlike sports betting, where the firm sets a line, event contracts leverage the power and rigor of financial market structure and are offered in a marketplace where buyers and sellers interact to set the price,\" the blog post said.\n\nWith this move Robinhood could be coming after some of the traditional betting platforms, such as DraftKings (DKNG) and Fanduel parent Flutter Entertainment (FLUT).\n\nThe launch marks Robinhood’s latest move into prediction markets after previously signaling interest in the space.\n\nIn March, the company rolled out a broader “Prediction Markets Hub” available through CFTC-regulated exchange Kalshi, following the popularity of crypto-native platforms like Polymarket, where users bet on outcomes ranging from elections to inflation rates using USDC.\n\nWhile Polymarket operated in a regulatory gray zone in the U.S., it recently said it is preparing an official return to the U.S. through the acquisition of QCX, a regulated derivatives exchange, following a federal investigation into Polymarket's operations that was dropped.\n\nHowever, Robinhood sidestepped those regulatory concerns by partnering with Kalshi, which is an exchange already licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That allows Robinhood to tap into sports, politics and macroeconomic event trading without triggering gambling laws.\n\nToday's news is likely a step into a broader strategy as Robinhood starts with sports betting, one of the most popular betting avenues. \"We currently offer contracts across crypto, economics, financials, sports, culture, and more, with others being added regularly,\" the post said.\n\n\"Ultimately, our goal is to enable anyone, anywhere, to trade, invest or hold any financial asset and conduct any financial transaction through Robinhood.\"\n\nRead more: U.S. Election Betting: Polymarket 'Manipulation' Claims Miss the Mark\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Polymarket, the online betting exchange where users wager on real-world outcomes, has weighed a deal that would value the company at $9 billion, according to The Information.\n\nThe number marks a sharp climb from its $1 billion valuation just three months ago, when it raised funds in a round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.\n\nThe rise comes as regulators loosen restrictions. In 2021, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission barred Polymarket from offering prediction contracts in the U.S. But earlier this year the agency gave the platform the green light to operate domestically, opening the door for new growth.\n\nPolymarket allows users to place bets on political elections, court rulings and geopolitical events. During the last U.S. election cycle alone, the site processed more than $8 billion in wagers. That puts it ahead of sports betting giants FanDuel, DraftKings and Betfair in terms of online traffic.\n\nCompetitor Kalshi has also seen its valuation rise. The company, which offers similar real-money event contracts, is now valued at $5 billion, up from $2 billion earlier this year, according to the same report. The jump suggests investors are betting that regulated prediction markets could become mainstream.\n\nPolymarket has also attracted politically connected backers. Donald Trump Jr.’s venture capital firm, 1789 Capital, invested in the company in a deal worth tens of millions of dollars, with Trump Jr. joining as an advisor.\n\nPrediction markets like Polymarket remain controversial in Washington, where critics argue they risk fueling misinformation.

These amended filings are often interpreted as a signal that the regulator is working toward approval. But a federal shutdown would grind most of that work to a halt.\n\nOne person familiar with the process said they believe some approvals could still land as soon as next week — assuming the government remains open. In particular, spot solana ETF applications are thought to be close, with several rounds of comments from the SEC already addressed. Issuers are still expected to file their final S-1 forms.\n\nAdding to the momentum, the SEC last week asked listing exchanges to withdraw their 19b-4 filings and re-submit under the General Listing Standards — a procedural shift expected after those standards were approved earlier this year. That move further hinted the agency was preparing to greenlight new products.\n\nOctober is packed with decision deadlines. Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF is due for a response by October 2. Several other applications face final deadlines between October 10 and 24 — dates that now risk slipping into a holding pattern if Congress fails to pass a funding bill before midnight this Tuesday.\n\nA shutdown would furlough much of the federal government, including staff at the SEC. While a skeleton crew would stay on to handle \"essential\" business, it’s unclear whether crypto ETFs fall into that category. In past shutdowns, regulatory reviews on financial products were often paused unless deemed critical to market stability.\n\nThere’s also the possibility that the SEC has already finalized much of the paperwork behind closed doors. That could allow approvals to proceed before the deadlines — or even during a shutdown — but that scenario remains speculative.\n\nIn the meantime, issuers and exchanges are left to wait, watching the calendar and Capitol Hill with growing anxiety.\n\nThe ETF race — particularly for spot crypto products — has heated up in 2025 after the SEC's surprise approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Many of the same firms behind those products are now pushing for funds tied to alternative assets like Solana and Litecoin, aiming to expand the roster of regulated investment options tied to crypto.\n\nBut for now, politics may have the final say.\n\nCorrection (Sept. 30, 2025, 15:12 UTC): The government is due to shut down after Tuesday.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

But don't build on top of someone else's coin,\" Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a statement. \"With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.\"\n\nIssuers can balance reserves between Treasuries and cash, with asset management handled by BlackRock, Fidelity, Superstate and Lead Bank. Stripe’s network ensures interoperability across tokens and aims to offer lower conversion costs.\n\nThe AI side of the showcase centered on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The offering allows merchants to transact with AI agents while keeping control over fulfillment and customer relationships, the firm said. Partners including Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic are also testing the standard.\n\nThese product launches build on a series of blockchain-focused moves by Stripe. In addition to acquiring Bridge, Stripe recently bought crypto wallet provider Privy, expanding its in-house crypto infrastructure tools. The firm is also working with crypto venture firm Paradigm to develop Tempo, a payments-oriented blockchain designed to handle transactions at scale.\n\n\"With the advent of stablecoins and AI, we’re at the dawn of a new online economy,\" Will Gaybrick, Stripe's president of technology and business, said in a statement, adding that the company is focusing on \"pulling frontier technology out of the experimental into the mainstream.\"\n\nRead more: Why Circle and Stripe (And Many Others) Are Launching Their Own Blockchains\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "U.S. bank Citizens began coverage of Circle Internet (CRCL) with a market perform rating, noting that while the company is poised to capitalize on stablecoin growth, its valuation already captures much of the upside.\n\nCircle, issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, the dollar-pegged USDC, and euro-pegged EURC, has built a broad infrastructure suite, including a payments network, cross-chain protocol and programmable wallets. It is working on Arc, a planned layer-1 blockchain, that Citizens sees as central to programmable money in payments, trading and tokenization.\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a real-world asset such as a currency or gold. They are used to transfer money and for cross border payments. Tether's USDT, the biggest, has a market cap of about $175 billion.\n\nStablecoins are at an inflection point, analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote, and the industry market cap could rise from about $300 billion today to $3 trillion by 2030 as regulatory clarity from the U.S. GENIUS Act, Europe’s MiCA and other regimes fuels adoption.\n\nWith USDC circulation doubling year-over-year to roughly $74 billion, fully backed by cash and treasuries, the bank's analysts see Circle’s compliance-first approach as a key competitive moat.\n\nThe company is also well capitalized, with more than $1 billion in cash after its June IPO and follow-on offering, giving it room to invest and pursue acquisitions. But at $133 per share, Circle trades at premium multiples of 39x and 23x EV/2026E and 2027E Ebitda, which Citizens says reflects leadership but limits upside unless adoption or monetization accelerate.\n\nKey factors to watch include USDC growth, margins, fee revenue ramp and sensitivity to yields. Citizens points to upcoming catalysts such as new payment corridors, enterprise partnerships, Arc’s testnet and MiCA implementation, while noting risks from yield compression, Coinbase distribution, competition and regulation remain manageable.\n\nCircle rose higher in early trading to around $134.40.\n\nRead more: Stablecoin Market Surges on U.S. Regulation, With Circle's USDC Gaining Ground: JPMorgan\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The integration extends to 11 blockchains including Ethereum, Avalanche and Base, bringing access to nearly 15,000 decentralized apps that can now support direct Bitcoin deposits.\n\nUntil now, most of these blockchains lacked a straightforward way to connect to Bitcoin. Users often had to navigate complex bridging processes, which carried both technical friction and security risks.\n\nWith BOB Gateway, they can move between native BTC and wBTC.OFT in one step, a change that could make strategies such as yield farming or looping trades more accessible to retail and institutional investors alike.\n\nYield farming and looping supply liquidity to DeFi platforms, acting as the foundation for lending, borrowing, and trading. This process allows users to earn significant passive income. Making these trades easier with native BTC — the largest and most trusted digital asset — would mobilize a massive pool of capital, increasing DeFi's liquidity, security, and overall market maturity.\n\nMore than $2.3 billion worth of wBTC.OFT has already been bridged across 67,000 transfers on LayerZero, the companies said. By enabling direct inflows from native BTC, the gateway could bring fresh liquidity into DeFi markets that rely on wrapped bitcoin as collateral or trading pairs.\n\nAlexei Zamyatin, co-founder of BOB, said the update “makes wBTC.OFT instantly accessible” across supported chains, while LayerZero’s Simon Baksys described the move as adding utility to “one of the most trusted assets in crypto.”\n\nThe rollout includes Ethereum, Avalanche, Base, Unichain, Soneium, Bera, Optimism, Sei, Sonic and BOB itself, covering much of the current DeFi landscape.\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bakkt (BKKT) may have surged 170% in just two weeks, but one Wall Street firm says the rally hasn’t erased the stock’s upside potential.\n\nBroker Benchmark raised its price target on the crypto infrastructure company to $40 from $13, while reiterating its buy rating on the stock. The shares were 2% higher in early trade, around $26.\n\nEven after the run-up, Bakkt trades at just 9.9 times estimated 2026 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), according to Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer.\n\nThat’s far below peers including Coinbase (24.1x), Robinhood (45.5x) and Circle (49.9x). Benchmark argues the relative discount makes the stock look inexpensive given its growth profile.\n\nThe rally, Palmer said, validates the strategic reset under CEO Akshay Naheta, who took sole leadership in August. The firm has opportunities in three areas: crypto infrastructure, stablecoin payments and a newly unveiled bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,529.37\ntreasury strategy.\n\nThe company has sold off its custody division and is in the process of exiting its legacy loyalty business, both of which were costly and non-core. With those units gone, Benchmark expects Bakkt to achieve profitability in the first half of 2026.\n\nInvestors also took note of the appointment of fintech veteran Mike Alfred to Bakkt’s board on Sept. 22.

    "title": "Kill the Captcha: They Don't Work, Here's What Does",
    "content": "Over the past two decades, there has been one prevalent method to distinguish humans from robots — the CAPTCHA test. These pesky, annoying picture-based tests have had us all staring at blurry pictures of mundane artifacts, from traffic lights to buses and bicycles, trying to determine which boxes made up the entire image. Successfully solving one ostensibly meant one thing: that you were human, not a bot in disguise, and you deserved to be let through the internet gates to view whatever content was behind the test. And all was well with the world. Until it wasn’t.\n\nNowadays, things aren’t as straightforward as they used to be. Bots and AI agents are growing smarter by the day, and today, they are at a level where solving a picture-based test is an easy feat. For context, a group of researchers at the University of California, Irvine recently discovered that artificial intelligence (AI) bots have now become even more adept than humans at solving CAPTCHAs.\n\nTo curb this problem, developers have resorted to making CAPTCHA tests harder to keep the bots out. But that’s a zero-sum game, and harder tests will only lead to worse online experiences for humans, while AI will just get better at solving them.\n\nIt has become increasingly evident that the only way to counteract this issue truly is to replace the current model with a newer, better one. If you buy a lock and thieves keep breaking it to get into your house, you don’t keep buying other, expensive locks. Instead, you pivot to other alternatives to keep them out. Similarly, web developers need to adopt a new approach to identity verification on the internet.\n\nThe CAPTCHA was premised on a simple truth that machines struggled at pattern recognition tasks that came naturally to people. That advantage has collapsed.\n\nAdvances in computer vision, reinforcement learning and large language models have made modern AI better at solving CAPTCHA than most humans. Image-recognition systems routinely spot crosswalks or bicycles with near-perfect accuracy. Behavioral bots can mimic mouse movements and timing patterns to fool detection systems. Multimodal language models can parse distorted text that once stumped software. In head-to-head tests, bots now register accuracy rates over 95%, while humans often hover much lower, slowed by fatigue, poor design, or accessibility challenges.\n\nThis inversion has produced a perverse arms race. Each new CAPTCHA becomes more difficult in an effort to trip up machines, but that only makes them more challenging for humans, too. The result isn’t security, but frustration as websites repel genuine users while the most sophisticated bots glide through.\n\nRecent events show just how fragile the system has become. In mid-2025, OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Agent bypassed Cloudflare’s “I am not a robot” check without detection. A year earlier, researchers at ETH Zurich demonstrated AI models that could solve Google’s reCAPTCHA v2 image challenges with 100% success. These aren’t isolated cracks — they’re signs that the CAPTCHA’s entire premise has collapsed.\n\nOnline identity has outgrown the old problem it was designed to solve. Stopping bots from claiming free email accounts was once the central challenge. Today, the stakes are far higher with the integrity of financial systems, the trustworthiness of elections, and even the distribution of humanitarian aid depending on knowing who is, and isn’t, a real human being.\n\nCAPTCHAs were never built to handle problems on this scale. They can filter out crude spam bots, but they are powerless against coordinated armies of fake accounts, automated propaganda networks, or deepfake-driven impersonations. The same generative AI that shreds image puzzles can also manufacture endless synthetic identities, amplifying disinformation or gaming online systems at will. In this context, the “prove you’re not a robot” checkbox feels like a lock on a screen door.\n\nA fundamental shift is now necessary. We need a system that can establish humanness without requiring disclosure of everything else. That means privacy by design, protections for basic rights, and usability simple enough for anyone to adopt. If we can’t verify personhood in a way that is both trustworthy and humane, the digital systems we rely on will continue to erode under the weight of synthetic actors.\n\nIf CAPTCHAs mark the end of an era, proof of personhood can mark the beginning of a new one. The goal isn’t to reinvent puzzles for the web, but to establish a higher-order layer of trust, a way to confirm that a real human is present, without demanding more than that.\n\nA passport offers a helpful analogy. It doesn’t reveal your entire life story at a border, it simply verifies that you are who you claim to be, and that you hold standing as a person in a recognized system. A digital proof of personhood can play a similar role online. Instead of distorted text or image grids, it would operate on principles that are…\n\nIn the same way passports unlocked cross-border trust, digital proof of personhood could unlock cross-network trust. It offers a path out of the arms race between bots and CAPTCHA, replacing brittle tests with a durable foundation for verifying humanity itself.\n\nThe collapse of the CAPTCHA is more than a technical inconvenience, it’s a signal. For twenty years, we trusted in these puzzles to keep the internet human, but AI has outgrown them. The challenge ahead isn’t to make harder tests, it’s to build better foundations.\n\nProof of personhood points the way. By treating humanness as a right to be verified, not a hurdle to be cleared, we can protect the systems that matter most like finance, governance, aid, and the everyday digital spaces where trust is currency. The lesson of the CAPTCHA era is clear: brittle defenses break under pressure. The lesson of the passport era is equally clear with durable identity systems, built with rights at their core, can last generations.\n\nThe question isn’t whether we can keep bots out. AI will only keep getting smarter. The question is whether we can design systems that are visible, respected, and trusted across networks. That’s the real test. And it’s one we can’t afford to fail.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

PEPE’s price steadily declined throughout the overnight and morning hours, briefly consolidating near $0.000092 before sliding lower.\n\nDespite the drop, activity in derivatives markets continued to build and PEPE has managed to outperform the memecoin sector, which as measured by the CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME) is down 3% in the past 24 hours.\n\nOpen interest in PEPE futures reached $560 million according to CoinGlass data, while total trading volume climbed to $1.2 billion.\n\nFor now, market watchers are focused on whether PEPE can maintain its foothold above the $0.000091 support zone or risks slipping toward lower ranges.\n\nA break above $0.000095 could shift sentiment, but any such move would need to be supported by stronger volume and confirmation from broader market conditions.\n\nPEPE’s 24-hour trading range covered a $0.0000034 spread, about 4% between session highs and lows. Sellers consistently emerged near $0.000095, making it a clear resistance level for now.\n\nSupport near $0.000092 held up during early and mid-session tests but weakened into the final hours.

    "title": "Stablecoin Market Surges on U.S. Regulation, With Circle's USDC Gaining Ground: JPMorgan",
    "content": "JPMorgan analysts said the stablecoin market has pulled ahead of the broader crypto ecosystem this year, fueled in part by the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act.\n\nAt nearly $300 billion, the market has grown 42% year-to-date, nearly double the 21% growth of crypto overall, according to a report published Tuesday.\n\nThe report notes that stablecoins now make up about 7.5% of the $3.8 trillion total crypto market cap and roughly 1.3% of the U.S. M2 money supply, up 35 basis points since the start of the year.\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing among other things a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally.\n\nSince the GENIUS Act was signed on July 18, the stablecoin market cap has climbed 19%, underscoring how regulation has accelerated adoption, according to the bank.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary appears to be Circle's (CRCL) USDC. JPMorgan analysts noted that after stagnating earlier in the year, its market cap has surged in the third quarter, rising from $61.5 billion at the end of June to $73.7 billion by late September, giving it a 25.5% share of the stablecoin market, up about 400 basis points in 2025.\n\nTether, meanwhile, has seen its dominance shrink, dropping from 67.5% at the start of the year to 60.4%, the bank said. Ethena’s synthetic stablecoin USDe has also gained ground, growing to $14.4 billion in circulation and securing a 5% share.\n\nFor years, USDT and USDC have defined a duopoly in the dollar stablecoin market, but that balance is shifting. JPMorgan said USDC has steadily eaten into Tether’s lead, now commanding nearly 30% of the two coins’ combined share, up from 24% at the start of the year.\n\nThe GENIUS Act may be tilting momentum further toward Circle, the analysts said, though a more fragmented market could ultimately benefit platforms like Bullish (BLSH) that provide liquidity services for a growing roster of stablecoin issuers.\n\nBullish is the owner of CoinDesk.\n\nRead more: U.S. Stablecoin Battle Could Be Zero-Sum Game: JPMorgan\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Trump Signs GENIUS Act Into Law, Elevating First Major Crypto Effort to Become Policy",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald Trump fulfilled part of his vow to establish U.S. crypto regulations on Friday, signing legislation into law that formally established rules for stablecoin issuers — marking a first step that the digital assets industry hopes will end with the more important regulatory regime governing the wider crypto markets.\n\nBefore a crowd of crypto executives in the East Room of the White House, a jubilant Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which registered a massive 308-122 bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday and an earlier 68-30 vote in the Senate — demonstrating a huge margin of support from Democrats.\n\nTrump walked into a packed East Room filled with applauding lawmakers and industry leaders, including Coinbase's Brian Armstrong, Tether's Paolo Ardoino, Circle's Jeremy Allaire, Gemini's Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Kraken's Dave Ripley, Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov and others.\n\n\"So congratulations, you've come a long way since the Biden administration, when they had no idea what you were all talking about, and half of you are under arrest,\" he joked at the outset.\n\nTrump called out various members of Congress by name, alongside members of his Cabinet, saying they were instrumental in moving the legislation, as well as various industry leaders attending the ceremony.\n\n\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" he said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago, but this signing is a massive validation.\"\n\nThe GENIUS Act will now be forwarded to the federal financial and banking agencies that must implement its various provisions. That will include formalizing the definitions for what kind of firms make acceptable issuers of stablecoins, which is a field currently dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, though Wall Street institutions have been jumping into the space at a rapid pace.\n\nImplementation of a law by federal regulators can be a drawn-out process, but GENIUS at least gives the industry a broad roadmap for how its U.S. interactions will look in the future. So pressure now shifts from lobbying to execution for stablecoin companies.\n\n\"The act sets a necessarily compliance baseline, but whether stablecoins can deliver their promise will depend on how effectively stablecoin issuers disclose reserves, implement operational safeguards, maintain robust governance practices and ensure structural alignment between issuers interests and consumer protection,\" noted Rajeev Bamra, an associate managing director for digital economy at Moody's Ratings, in a statement. \"With broader adoption comes greater systemic responsibility of market participants.\"\n\nThe industry has come a long way in Washington since its tumultuous 2022 in which several major businesses failed spectacularly, and crypto-supporting lawmakers were burned by the fall of global exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was a fixture in congressional meetings and the industry's D.C. events. But aggressive lobbying and a major campaign-finance push from the industry's Fairshake political action committee during last year's congressional elections elevated the sector into the good graces of the White House and Congress.\n\nTrump has declared himself the crypto president, and his administration has routinely called for a \"golden age\" for the industry to begin. Now that GENIUS is law, the focus shifts toward the bigger task of passing legislation that defines the proper oversight of different forms of cryptocurrency, trading platforms and projects and assigns federal agencies to new roles as watchdogs over these markets.\n\nWhite House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks took the podium briefly to praise Trump and the legislation, saying that while he's used to the tech world moving quickly, the speed at which GENIUS became law \"this was fast for us in Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\"This GENIUS Act will unlock American dominance in the crypto industry by creating clear rules of the road,\" he said. \"It will update archaic payment rails with a revolutionary new payment system, and it will extend U.S. dollar dominance, like [Trump] said, globally by creating a digital dollar that people all over the world can use. And for every digital dollar in a crypto wallet, there'll be a traditional dollar in a U.S. bank account, which will create trillions of dollars demand for U.S Treasuries.\"\n\nThe Digital Asset Market Clarity Act that also swept through the House with a 294-134 vote on Thursday, at the peak of what lawmakers were calling \"Crypto Week,\" has delivered momentum and a message to the Senate in its ongoing writing of its own market structure bill. Representative French Hill, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, urged in a press conference following Thursday's win for the Clarity Act that senators should just take up his bill and amend it rather than embark on their own legislation.\n\n\"Put it through your process,\" Hill advised the Senate — specifically Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. \"Obviously, it's open to amendment. It's a collaborative process.\"\n\nThe Senate hasn't yet released a draft of its bill, only a series of principles it intends to follow. So it remains unclear when the crypto advocates may again return to witness Trump signing a market structure bill, though Senator Scott assured the White House he's set a Sept. 30 deadline for Senate action.\n\nRead More: Can Tether's Dominance Survive the U.S. Stablecoin Bill?\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The $270 billion stablecoin sector has grown significantly but still accounts for less than 8% of crypto’s total market cap, a level it has held since 2020, according to a JPMorgan research note.\n\nThat dynamic could turn the coming wave of U.S. stablecoin launches into a zero-sum contest, unless the crypto market itself expands significantly, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.\n\nTether, whose USDT is primarily used overseas, plans to debut a U.S.-compliant token, USAT. Unlike USDT, whose reserves are about 80% compliant with U.S. requirements, USAT’s backing would fully meet the new regulatory standards, the bank said.\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. Tether's USDT is the largest stablecoin, followed by Circle's (CRCL) USDC.\n\nThe passage of U.S. stablecoin legislation in July has already spurred a fresh round of launches aimed at Circle’s USDC, which dominates the U.S. market, the report noted.\n\nWhile new players are jockeying for position ahead of regulatory implementation, the stablecoin market’s growth remains tied to crypto’s overall market cap, the analysts wrote.\n\nCircle is also losing ground to competitors like Hyperliquid, whose exchange alone accounts for nearly 7.5% of USDC usage, as well as fintech giants PayPal (PYPL), Robinhood (HOOD), and Revolut, which are rolling out their own tokens, JPMorgan said.\n\nIn response, Circle is developing Arc, a blockchain tailored to USDC transactions, to improve speed, security, and interoperability and keep USDC central to crypto infrastructure.\n\nWithout significant expansion, the new wave of stablecoin competition may simply redistribute market share rather than grow the pie, the report added.\n\nUSDC supply has surged to $72.5 billion, 25% ahead of Wall Street firm Bernstein's 2025 estimates, the broker said in a report earlier this month.\n\nRead more: Circle's USDC Market Share 'On a Tear,' Says Wall Street Broker Bernstein\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPolkadot's DOT Consolidates After Sharp Decline\n\nThe token slumped 4% amid a wider decline in crypto markets.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Gold’s historic rally accelerated on Monday, with spot prices punching through $3,800 per ounce to set fresh all-time record, extending a torrid year in which bullion is up roughly almost 47% year-to-date.\n\nThat surge is echoing on across crypto rails, with gold-backed tokens climbing to an all-time high market capitalization of $2.88 billion, CoinGecko data shows. Tokenized versions of the metal are backed by physical reserves but settle on blockchain rails, offering round-the-clock trading and near-instant transfers.\n\nXAUT\n$4,054.18\nand Paxos'\nPAXG\n$4,058.68\n, both tokens issued by firms predominantly known for their stablecoins, are dominating the category. XAUT’s capitalization stood near $1.43 billion and PAXG’s at roughly $1.12 billion, both at their respective all-time highs.\n\nLiquidity has swelled alongside the rally, too. PAXG attracted more than $40 million in net inflows during September and set a fresh trading volume record surpassing $3.2 billion in monthly turnover.\n\nXAUT also posted a record $3.25 billion in monthly volume, per DeFiLlama. Meanwhile, the token's market cap growth came solely from the underlying metal's appreciation, as no new token minting happened this month after August's $437 million jump.\n\nThe tokenized gold market could continue gaining as macro conditions remain supportive for the yellow metal.

Grayscale’s submission is scheduled for October 18, with others queued through November 14, creating a concentrated window of regulatory catalysts that could reshape near-term flows.\n\n• Market sentiment has been buoyed by anticipation of increased corporate portfolio exposure. Analysts frame ETF approvals as a structural driver that could accelerate XRP’s adoption within institutional allocation strategies.\n\n• XRP traded within a $0.10 corridor, fluctuating between a low of $2.84 and a high of $2.93, reflecting 3.5% volatility during the period. Price capped out near $2.93 where selling pressure intensified, particularly during the September 29 14:00 session.\n\n• The most significant upward moves came at 02:00 and 07:00 GMT on September 29, where volume spiked to over 97 million units. These surges significantly outpaced the daily average of 57.4 million, confirming institutional participation during rally phases.\n\n• The final hour of trading extended the advance, as price moved from $2.88 to $2.90 for a 0.7% late gain. The breach of the $2.90 psychological barrier was confirmed by a 4.8 million unit volume burst, taking the session to its highs before settling around $2.9045.\n\n• Resistance is clustered between $2.92 and $2.93, where price repeatedly stalled on higher volume. This zone marks the next hurdle for continuation, with breakout confirmation likely requiring a close above $2.93 on expanding participation.\n\n• Support has consolidated between $2.85 and $2.86, where buyers consistently defended bids during retracements. Multiple successful retests of this band throughout the session highlight its importance as an accumulation zone.\n\n• The $2.90 psychological level has shifted into a near-term pivot.

    "content": "SINGAPORE — SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said Tuesday that the regulator is open to engaging with industry participants on tokenizing products, while emphasising the complexity of how these tokenized assets interact with their traditional counterparts.\n\n\"We are willing to work with people who want to tokenize, we urge them to come talk to us,\" Peirce said while speaking at the Digital Assets Summit in Singapore.\n\nA tokenized security is a blockchain-based digital representation of ownership or rights in an underlying asset, such as stocks or bonds. It means the same security can exist in both traditional paper certificates and electronic certificates, as well as in blockchain-based tokens.\n\nThe key issue Peirce pointed to is understanding how these different forms of the same security relate to and interact with one another.\n\n\"Some of the questions are how does a tokenized security interact with other iterations of the security and other forms of that security,\" Peirce explained, while calling for a nuanced approach to regulating tokenization, saying,\n\n\"Depending on how things are tokenized, it could be one of many different things,\" she noted.\n\nTokenization stands out as one of the few cryptocurrency sub-sectors, alongside stablecoins, with significant real-world applications. Financial institutions worldwide are adopting tokenization to improve market liquidity and operational efficiency, driving a transformative shift in how assets are issued, traded, and managed in the global financial system.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the total on-chain tokenisation market was valued at $31 billion, according to RWA.xyz, with $714 million of that being tokenized stocks.\n\nMcKinsey analysis indicates that the market cap of all tokenized assets could reach around $2 trillion by 2030.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin and Ether ETFs Saw Big Inflows Tuesday as Investors Bought Dip\n\nThe spot bitcoin funds drew in nearly $900 million, while the ether ETFs pulled more than $400 million.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

These include payment authorization, invoicing and dispute resolution, to make stablecoin transfers viable.\n\nInstitutional firms such as Zodia Custody, Bitso and Borderless are among the initial adopters, looking to combine stablecoin speed with compliance standards familiar to traditional finance (TradFi).\n\nThere’s a lot happening around stablecoin payments at the moment, including the announcement this week that Swift, the long-established interbank messaging platform, will unveil its own blockchain-based stablecoin system for payments.\n\nAn obstacle to stablecoin payments is that most crypto transactions are “push-only,” leaving businesses without safeguards to reverse payments or block fraud, Notabene said. The firm’s new application introduces pull payments, recurring billing and standardized coordination between verified participants, backed by the company’s network of 2,000+ regulated entities.\n\nThe platform relies on the Transaction Authorization Protocol, an open standard that functions rather like a Swift-style messaging layer. Notabene partnered with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), a way of achieving entity verification anchored to the internationally recognized LEI standard, giving every participant a reliable foundation of counterparty trust.\n\n“Cross-border B2B payments have always been slow, expensive, and complex,\" Pelle Braendgaard, Notabene CEO said. \"Stablecoins are the first real opportunity to change that, but these high-value payments need a trust framework to succeed at scale. Notabene Flow delivers that framework.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

But leaders of both have said they want the borders between securities and commodities to be seamless, allowing single firms or even apps to traverse both without difficulty.\n\n\"Our two agencies must work in lockstep,\" Atkins told a crowd of financial compliance lawyers and industry representatives at the SEC headquarters in Washington. \"What matters is building a framework where our agencies coordinate seamlessly.\"\n\nRead More: SEC, CFTC Chiefs Say Crypto Turf Wars Over as Agencies Move Ahead on Joint Work\n\nThe CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham added, \"It's a new day, and the turf war is over.\"\n\nThough it's an unusually powerful sentiment from these agencies, which have often been at odds with each other, the CFTC side is still absent a permanent leader to assure its strategic decisions won't be shifted under new management. But Pham spent some of her time at the microphone assuring the crowd that her agency is moving at a rapid pace under her leadership.\n\n\"The CFTC is alive and well, and there needs to be no more FUD about what's going on,\" she said, evoking the common crypto-world acronym for \"fear, uncertainty and doubt.\"\n\nAtkins commented on the CFTC leadership under Pham, with whom he's been working together on crypto initiatives, as \"full-speed ahead.\"\n\nOn the sidelines of the roundtable event, the SEC chairman told reporters that \"obviously, top priority right now is crypto.\"\n\nHe said in response to a question from CoinDesk that President Donald Trump \"kind of laid down the gauntlet\" and wants to sign a market structure bill by the end of the year. \"We'll see how that goes.\"\n\nAsset tokenization will be one particular area of SEC focus, he said, though he said it may take \"a year or two\" to erect regulatory guardrails around the activity.\n\n\"The potential is pretty much endless,\" he said.\n\nAtkins also dismissed speculation about the SEC and CFTC merging, calling it \"fanciful.\"\n\nThe Monday roundtable was the latest SEC event that put some focus on the crypto space, though this one represented a wider cooperation between the agencies.

But IBIT’s surge signals a structural power shift as options once driven by high-leverage offshore venues are increasingly anchored in the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, Checkonchain data shows IBIT ETF’s leverage ratio has reached 45%, near all-time highs.\n\nThe ETF holds 770,000 BTC, while options open interest stands at 340,000 BTC, meaning nearly half of IBIT’s underlying exposure is mirrored in derivatives. This highlights the scale of speculative positioning tied to the ETF, though it is debatable whether this fully reflects market leverage.\n\nIBIT now accounts for 45% of global BTC options open interest dominance, overtaking Deribit at 41.9%, with CME at just 6% and other exchanges making up the rest.\n\nThis concentration indicates that IBIT and Deribit together command almost 90% of the BTC options market.\n\nThe data suggests two takeaways: IBIT’s growing role in derivatives trading is reshaping the market, and institutional platforms like CME remain small when compared with ETF-driven and retail-dominated venues.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin and Ether ETFs Saw Big Inflows Tuesday as Investors Bought Dip\n\nThe spot bitcoin funds drew in nearly $900 million, while the ether ETFs pulled more than $400 million.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Keel Debuts as Sky's Solana-Focused 'Star' With a $2.5B Roadmap to Boost RWAs and DeFi",
    "content": "Keel, a new Solana-native capital allocator, debuted on Tuesday with a roadmap to channel up to $2.5 billion across decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenized asset markets in the Solana\nSOL\n$221.27\necosystem.\n\nKeel is structured as being part of the Sky ecosystem, the long-running DeFi protocol formerly known as MakerDAO, as one of its autonomous units called \"stars.\" That's part of Sky's major overhaul dubbed Endgame that includes creating smaller units, each of which is responsible for its own governance and innovation at the edge of the ecosystem. Sky is centered around issuing the USDS (USDS) and\nDAI\n$0.9997\ndecentralized stablecoins, which have a combined supply of over $7 billion.\n\nSpark, the first of Sky's stars, has grown to more than $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum while allocating funds to over $1 billion in tokenized assets. Grove, the second unit launched earlier this year, is focused on collateralized loan obligations.\n\nKeel's mandate is acting as an on-chain capital allocator that sits between Solana DeFi protocols and the broader stablecoin economy. It receives a dedicated balance sheet from the USDS stablecoin reserves to deploy and support Solana-native protocols to generate yield. Early integrations include Kamino, Jupiter and Raydium, Solana-hosted marketplaces where liquidity can serve as a foundation for lending markets, routing and liquidity pools.\n\n\"Keel was founded on the belief that the next phase of on-chain finance growth needs more than new assets alone; it needs liquidity that can be accessed at speed and scale,\" said Cian Breathnach, CEO of Matariki Labs and a contributor to Keel. \"Keel is the first to provide these enablers on Solana, delivering the capital and catalyzing force for the next stage of growth in on-chain lending, borrowing, tokenization and more.\"\n\nKeel's plan could also help attract more tokenized real-world assets (RWA) to the Solana space, a fast-growing sector that aims to use blockchain rails to move and settle traditional financial assets like bonds, commodities and stocks.\n\nLily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, called Keel \"a key step\" in positioning the blockchain as a leading marketplace for internet-scale capital markets. Rune Christensen, co-founder of Sky, added that Keel is set to become the largest capital allocator on Solana and will play a key role in shaping the DeFi and RWA landscape.\n\nRead more: Blockchain-Based RWA Specialists Bring $50M to Apollo's Tokenized Credit Strategy\n\nMore For You\n\nCrypto Life Insurer Anthea Raises $22M to Launch Ethereum-Denominated Policy\n\nThe funding round led by Yunfeng Financial Group will support the rollout of Anthea’s blockchain-based life insurance.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Chainlink said it developed a technical process allowing banks to interact with tokenized investment funds through Swift, the interbank messaging system that underpins much of traditional finance.\n\nIn a pilot with UBS, Chainlink’s Runtime Environment (CRE) processed subscriptions and redemptions for a tokenized fund using ISO 20022 messages, the international standard for financial messaging used by Swift.\n\nThe blockchain workflows were triggered directly from UBS’s existing systems after CRE received the Swift messages. It then triggered the subscriptions or redemptions in the Chainlink Digital Transfer Agent, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nThe setup lets banks access blockchain infrastructure using tools they already use, like Swift, while Chainlink’s infrastructure handles the rest.\n\nThe pilot builds on previous work from Project Guardian, a tokenization initiative led by Singapore’s central bank. The latest development adds in interoperability that enables institutions to use Swift to trigger on-chain events.\n\nThe launch comes after Chainlink announced a separate pilot with 24 global banks and financial infrastructure providers like DTCC and Euroclear.

The stablecoin rules took effect in June 2024 and full legislation kicked in toward the end of December.\n\nThe initiative will begin with listing and trading the stablecoins on 360T’s digital exchange, 3DX, and through Crypto Finance, Deutsche Börse’s institutional crypto brokerage. Custody will be handled by Clearstream, the group’s post-trade arm, using Crypto Finance’s German entity as a sub-custodian.\n\n“Together with Deutsche Börse Group, we’re planning to advance the use of regulated stablecoins across Europe’s market infrastructure — reducing settlement risk, lowering costs, and improving efficiency for banks, asset managers, and the wider market,” said Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Circle.\n\nIn practice, the tie-up could allow banks, asset managers and other institutions to settle trades in tokenized euros or dollars, instead of relying on legacy payment systems.

It will probably need gold to relinquish some attention before its next move higher.\n\nThat might be a challenge, however. Gold continues to outperform, delivering nearly 50% year-to-date returns and climbing to another record high above $3,870 earlier today. At the same time, the dollar index (DXY) cannot generate momentum and has fallen below 98, which is positive for risk-assets.\n\nMeanwhile, an imminent U.S. government shutdown threatens to affect policy decisions around crypto more than any other area.\n\nEquities tied to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing continue to gain strength. Robinhood (HOOD), the trading platform added to the S&P 500 in its most recent rebalancing, saw its share price jump 12% on Monday as the quarter comes to a close.\n\nSeptember has been a pretty subdued month for cryptocurrencies, with the CoinDesk 20 Index little changed over the period, up just 0.54%. Ether\nETH\n$4,465.21\nlagged behind and is on track to lose more than 5% in the month.

NYDFS Executive Deputy Superintendent of Research and Innovation Kaitlin Asrow will take over as acting head of the agency. NYDFS was the first state regulator to issue specific rules for crypto firms with its landmark BitLicense, which came into effect 10 years ago.\n\nIn statements, Hochul and Harris thanked each other, with Hochul saying Harris worked \"every day to make our financial system work for New Yorkers, while also rebuilding the Department into a regulator fit for the financial capital of the world.\"\n\nHarris first took office as the acting superintendent in August 2021, after Hochul nominated her to the role, and was confirmed by New York's state senate the following January.\n\n\"It feels like yesterday and a lifetime ago, all at the same time,\" Harris said of her four-year tenure earlier Monday during an appearance at the Digital Asset Compliance & Market Integrity Summit hosted by Solidus Labs.\n\nIn that time, she said, NYDFS had issued 11 different pieces of regulatory guidance to bolster the regulator's landmark BitLicense.\n\n\"The industry had already changed so much from 2015 to 2021 when I came in, it felt really important that we start to add meat to the bones of the regulation,\" she said.\n\nThis included guidance for dealing with stablecoins, blockchain analytics and coin listings, among other pieces of information, she said.\n\n\"I think it's a real testament to what we've done out of DFS that folks in both chambers of Congress, folks on both sides of the aisle, come to us for our technical expertise, for advice, for edits, much of which have been incorporated — not all — but into the current market structure bill,\" she said.\n\nNYDFS also undertook investigations and enforcement actions, including into the Binance dollar stablecoin (BUSD) issued by stablecoin firm Paxos following an investigation dating back to 2023.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Washington has a narrow window to deliver clear U.S. crypto rules, Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argues, urging lawmakers to “finish the job on crypto clarity.”\n\nIn an op-ed published Monday on RealClearMarkets, Alderoty said the Securities and Exchange Commission has for the first time listed crypto clarity among its top priorities — signaling that “the time has come” for predictable oversight. He framed the issue as mainstream, not niche, pointing to consumer adoption and polling that shows broad support for stronger guardrails.\n\nAlderoty cited several data points to make the case.\n\nA National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) survey with Harris Poll found roughly one in five U.S. adults owns crypto. Pew Research reported that a majority of Americans lack confidence that current ways to invest, trade or use crypto are reliable and safe. And a YouGov poll showed more Americans favor tighter crypto regulation than looser rules.\n\nHe also referenced Chainalysis estimates that Americans transacted more than $1 trillion in digital assets in 2024, spanning uses from payments to savings.\n\n“The absence of clear, consistent rules doesn’t make crypto go away,” Alderoty wrote, warning it pushes activity to jurisdictions moving faster. He argued that clarity would both protect consumers and give responsible firms certainty to build in the U.S.\n\nAlderoty is also president of the National Cryptocurrency Association, a crypto education nonprofit launched on March 5 with a $50 million grant from Ripple. The NCA says it aims to boost literacy and safe adoption through explainers and user stories, and its polling finds most current users want to learn more about the technology.\n\nWith Congress weighing market-structure legislation after this summer’s stablecoin law, Alderoty cast the fall session as a pivotal moment. “The opportunity is in front of us. The mandate is already there,” he wrote, adding that lawmakers can “prove to Americans that Washington can, in fact, deliver clarity where it’s needed most.”\n\nHe concluded that finishing the rules would keep innovation onshore and ensure the U.S. leads in shaping future financial infrastructure.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "OKX SG, the Singapore-based unit of OKX, said it is bringing the crypto exchange's integrated payments service, OXK Pay, to the city-state through a stablecoin-powered scan-to-pay service tie-up with Southeast Asia's \"everyday everything\" app, Grab.\n\nOKX SG, which received a major payment institution license from the country's central bank just over a year ago, will work with crypto infrastructure provider StraitsX to allow customers to pay for everyday expenses using the two largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, USDT, issued by Tether, and USDC, issued by Circle Internet (CRCL).\n\nThe launch of OKX Pay is a sign of the increasing adoption of stablecoins in commercial networks across Asia and beyond. In some emerging markets, stablecoins are already widely used for remittances and day-to-day commerce, often preferred for their lower transaction fees and faster settlement times than conventional money transfers through traditional banking channels.\n\n\"OKX Pay addresses real needs for customers by expanding DPTs’ use beyond trading and investing to everyday payments — from a morning coffee to dining out with friends,\" Gracie Lin, CEO at OKX SG, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nThe system allows users to scan GrabPay SGQR codes at participating merchants and converts their USDT or USDC into XSGD, StraitsX's Singapore dollar-pegged stablecoin. The XSGD is then converted in the fiat currency and passed to merchant.\n\nStablecoins are tokens whose values are pegged to an external reference, typically a fiat currency. This pegging mechanism minimizes the price volatility typically seen in other cryptocurrencies, providing users with a digital asset that functions similarly to traditional money while offering the benefits of blockchain technology such as faster cross-border transactions and payment modes.\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, stablecoin transaction volumes have zoomed to over $800 billion a month from less than $100 billion in five years. The overall use of stablecoins in real world transaction is slowly picking up.\n\nAccording to a BCG white paper on stablecoins released in May 2025, stablecoins' payments-related uses such as cross-border remittances, merchant transactions and on-chain settlements now make up approximately 4%–6% of total activity. Meanwhile, trading related activities make up for 88% of the total.\n\nThe OKX Pay's three-step conversion ensures that merchants benefit from a simple, compliant way to accept stablecoin payments without having to handle digital payment tokens (DPTs) themselves.\n\nEvery OKX Pay transaction is executed as a blockchain transfer using the Monetary Authority of Singapore's purpose bound money (PBM) framework, which applies programmable logic to ensure compliant and conditional settlement.\n\n“The future of payments will be defined by trust, speed, and interoperability – and stablecoins are at the heart of this shift,\" Tianwei Liu, StraitsX CEO & co-founder, said in the statement. \"The launch of OKX Pay is more than a new service but a blueprint for how stablecoins will underpin global commerce in the years ahead.\"\n\nCORRECT (Sept. 30, 14:29 UTC): Removes incorrect reference to integration with Alipay+ from third paragraph.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin and Ether ETFs Saw Big Inflows Tuesday as Investors Bought Dip\n\nThe spot bitcoin funds drew in nearly $900 million, while the ether ETFs pulled more than $400 million.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers to withdraw their 19b-4 filings, paving the way for a faster approval process after new rules removed a key regulatory hurdle, a person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.\n\nEarlier this month, the SEC signed off on generic listing standards, which allow exchanges to list commodity-based exchange-traded products (ETPs), including those tied to cryptocurrencies, without requiring a separate review for each one. These changes are expected to lower the regulatory hurdles for launching spot crypto ETFs.\n\nHistorically, issuers had to work with exchanges to submit 19b-4 filings — formal requests to amend exchange rules — before an ETF could be listed. But under the updated framework, that step is no longer required for certain products. Issuers now only need to file an S-1, the document that details an ETF’s structure and strategy, to receive the SEC’s green light.\n\n“The SEC can move absurdly fast if they really want to — as we’ve seen in the past. Meaning that we could see approvals in a matter of days. But there’s no guarantee of that,\" said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\n\"They still haven’t greenlit Bitwise’s BITW to convert into an ETF which I’m guessing has to do with the first to file aspect that the SEC typically follows for the rest of the ETF industry. So perhaps they’ll will allow these things to launch in sorts of rolling waves or it could be a shotgun start by underlying asset.\"\n\nOver the past several months, asset managers have filed a growing list of spot crypto ETF proposals covering coins like Solana\nSOL\n$221.19\n,\nLTC\n$117.41\nand\nDOGE\n$0.2530\n. These proposals included both 19b-4 and S-1 filings, reflecting the two-part process required under the old rules.\n\nRemoving the need for 19b-4 forms could significantly speed up approvals. The 19b-4 route involved exchanges, such as Nasdaq or NYSE Arca, petitioning the SEC to change their own listing standards each time a new product was introduced — a process that often took months.\n\nNow, with the SEC’s updated stance, exchanges can list crypto-based ETFs that fall within the generic commodity ETP category without having to seek a rule change every time. This places the approval burden squarely on the S-1 filing, which remains under the SEC’s direct review.\n\nWhile it’s unclear how quickly the SEC will move on the outstanding S-1s, the change marks a shift in the agency’s approach to crypto markets — potentially opening the door for a wider range of digital asset funds to come to market with fewer regulatory delays.\n\n\"Everything is uncertain. Add in the prospect of a government shutdown and things can get really wonky,” Seyffart said.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin and Ether ETFs Saw Big Inflows Tuesday as Investors Bought Dip\n\nThe spot bitcoin funds drew in nearly $900 million, while the ether ETFs pulled more than $400 million.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Cipher Mining (CIFR) just delivered one of the most consequential weeks in its history, announcing a major AI hosting deal for its Barber Lake facility and a $1.1 billion convertible note offering, moves that together may redefine the company’s trajectory, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a report on Monday.\n\nCanaccord reiterated its buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to $16 from $12. The shares rose 1.2% in early trading to around $11.60.\n\nWhile the market had been expecting Cipher to secure an AI data center partner for Barber Lake before year-end, last week’s announcement went further than anticipated, the report said. CIFR inked an agreement with Fluidstack, backed by Google, confirming its place in the “miner pivot-to-AI” trend that is sweeping the industry.\n\nCrucially, the deal arrived in during a flurry of hyperscaler and GPU cloud provider contracts, helping to validate demand for large-scale AI compute and putting to rest some concerns about market size, at least in the near term, analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.\n\nThe positive sentiment around Cipher's prospects has been reflected in its share price over the past several months, giving the company a stronger currency for capital raising, the analysts noted.\n\nThe $1.1 billion convertible note priced last week at a 0.00% coupon, an unusually attractive cost of capital, and is expected to allow the company to retain 100% ownership of Barber Lake, Canaccord said.\n\nManagement had earlier signaled that it might be willing to sell a stake in the project to reduce leverage. With improved equity pricing and stronger market fundamentals, the company appears positioned to fund Barber Lake without giving up equity.\n\nMore AI deals are likely. The Barber Lake agreement does not cover the entire facility, leaving meaningful capacity available for future contracts. With a 2.6 gigawatt (GW) development pipeline, energized sites like Odessa and the ramping Black Pearl could also see AI co-location deals in the future, the report added.\n\nRead more: Cipher Mining Prices $1.1B Upsized Convertible Note Offering\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It also suggests a seasonal factor, with investors shifting focus from historical September weakness to October — sometimes dubbed \"Uptober\" due to the tendency for price to rise.\n\nBitcoin and other major cryptos — ETH, XRP and SOL among them — are all ahead by roughly 4% over the past 24 hours. Gold is ahead 1.2%, touching yet another record high above $3,850 per ounce and the Nasdaq is higher by 0.8%.\n\nAmong crypto-related stocks, Coinbase (COIN) and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) up 5.7% and 7.7%, respectively.\n\nParticularly hard hit during last week's carnage, miners are seeing a sizable bounce. Artificial intelligence and high performance computing focused stocks such as IREN (IREN) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) are both up 4%. MARA Holdings (MARA) — with a greater emphasis on pure bitcoin mining and stacking — is ahead 8%.\n\nThe small bounce is not surprising, said Paul Howard, senior director at trading firm Wincent, despite the macro environment being a little uncertain.\n\n\"We have seen institutional and retail support at $110,000 from those that missed BTC at the $100,000 level,\" he said in a note. \"There is still downside risk until we see a bigger macro move the coming month.\"\n\nFriday’s jobs report could offer traders a clearer view of the labor market, but a looming government shutdown threatens to delay the release.

    "title": "Chainlink Poised to Power TradFi Shift to Blockchain, Jefferies Says",
    "content": "Chainlink could become a foundational layer for traditional finance as capital markets increasingly embrace blockchain infrastructure, according to a report from investment bank Jefferies following a call with Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov.\n\nThe decentralized oracle network connects smart contracts to real-world data and off-chain systems, enabling advanced use cases like tokenized asset settlement, parametric insurance and cross-chain messaging.\n\nJefferies said LINK\nLINK\n$21.94\n, Chainlink’s native token, will benefit as tokenization accelerates.\n\nAs of September, Chainlink secured $103 billion in assets through its oracle feeds, up from $23 billion in early 2024, supporting over 2,500 projects. Partnerships with institutions such as Swift, DTCC, Euroclear and JPMorgan (JPM) underscore its role in bridging crypto and TradFi, wrote analysts Andrew Moss and Matthew Molta.\n\nTokenization, converting real-world assets into programmable digital tokens, is driving demand for infrastructure that can securely link on-chain and off-chain environments. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) address this challenge, supporting real-time settlement and automation across finance, insurance, and supply chains, the analysts wrote.\n\nJefferies said digital asset adoption remains early, but tokenization pilots are moving quickly toward production. With LINK used to pay for services, node operations and staking, growing demand for Chainlink’s infrastructure could provide token holders a call on future cash flows.\n\nWhile rivals like LayerZero and Pyth exist, Chainlink’s network effects and first-mover advantage may give it a durable moat in blockchain infrastructure, the bank said.\n\nThe analysts estimated that tokenized asset value has reached $30 billion excluding stablecoins, a 253% increase year to date.\n\nAs tokenization reduces operational costs and increases liquidity, Jefferies said it expects institutional investors to migrate toward blockchain-based settlement layers, placing Chainlink at the center of the transition.\n\nRead more: Polymarket Connects to Chainlink to Cut Tampering Risks in Price Bets\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Merz and Macron Are Right. The Internet of Value Needs Global Stablecoin Alignment",
    "content": "When French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently unveiled their joint economic agenda at the Franco-German Council of Ministers, one proposal stood out: pursuing collaboration and equivalence regimes with third countries in the field of crypto-asset regulation. It was a recognition that digital money, like data, does not stop at borders. And it was a timely reminder that stablecoins — the fastest-growing part of digital finance and crypto — will only fully succeed if regulators match their borderless design with cross-border collaboration.\n\nStablecoins are internet-native money: always on, borderless, programmable and available to anyone with a smartphone. Unlike traditional payment rails, they don’t close on weekends, don’t rely on complex correspondent banking networks and can move value between Bangkok and Boston in seconds. In many ways, they are the first serious upgrade to cross-border payments since SWIFT in the 1970s. Where SWIFT was a messaging network innovation to connect counterparty banks, stablecoins marry messaging with settlement to create a payments innovation breakthrough.\n\nBut their value proposition depends on being global. A patchwork of divergent national rulebooks would turn the “internet of value” into fragmented payment intranets — undermining the very efficiency and accessibility that make stablecoins transformative.\n\nThe good news: the world’s leading regulatory frameworks for stablecoins — Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and America’s GENIUS Act — already share the same foundation. Both require full 1:1 reserves in high-quality liquid assets, redemption at par, regular public reporting and strict governance, risk and anti-money laundering (AML) standards. Both allow issuance by banks and non-banks alike.\n\nThere are, of course, differences. GENIUS imposes tighter reserve rules (limited to short-dated Treasuries and reverse repos), while MiCA allows a broader mix, including longer-duration government bonds or even covered bonds, but also requires high minimum bank deposit ratios (30% or 60% of the reserve depending on token size). GENIUS requires monthly attestations, while MiCA mandates a white paper at launch. MiCA places issuance caps on non-euro stablecoins at scale; GENIUS creates strict barriers for Big Tech issuers and segregation requirements for banks aiming to launch stablecoins. These are examples of important differences, but they pale in comparison to the core alignment on what a safe, credible stablecoin looks like.\n\nWhere the frameworks diverge most is in how they treat foreign issuers.\n\nGENIUS introduces an explicit equivalence regime: stablecoins from “comparable jurisdictions” could be offered directly in the U.S. without duplicative licensing. That means that in the future, subject to U.S. Treasury Department approval, MiCA-compliant euro stablecoins could likely be offered to the entire U.S. market without the need for additional, local U.S. licenses.\n\nMiCA, by contrast, requires foreign issuers to set up a licensed EU entity and comply with all local requirements, including the need for local reserves, issuance and redemption, and disclosures proportionate to the EU share of the issuer’s holdings and activities — the so-called multi-issuance approach.\n\nThat difference reflects timing more than philosophy: the EU went first, seeking to bring global stablecoins into its perimeter after Libra published its first white paper in 2019. From its earliest impact assessments, Brussels warned against allowing foreign, non-EU issuers to escape oversight. MiCA even mandates data sharing by exchanges to help issuers better calculate their EU footprint and enable supervisors to monitor foreign issuers’ activities. Back when MiCA was adopted in 2023, it was too early to introduce a full equivalence regime. Still, the EU Commission was tasked with reviewing whether an equivalence regime could complement its approach in its interim review that is due this year. And the political signal is clear: Macron and Merz explicitly called for cross-border collaboration and building reciprocity mechanisms for stablecoins with trusted partners. The transatlantic stars are aligning.\n\nThe next 12–24 months will be decisive. With MiCA and GENIUS as key reference frameworks, the policy focus will shift from drafting rules to aligning them. The opportunity is enormous: a coordinated transatlantic approach would give businesses and consumers confidence that a fully backed, transparent redeemable digital euro or dollar-based stablecoin is the same payment instrument on either side of the Atlantic, independent of where it is licensed. It would also give other major economies a strong template to connect to — ensuring stablecoins evolve into a global public good rather than a regulatory race to the bottom.\n\nFailing to align would be costly. Corporations need stablecoins in multiple currencies to manage and modernize FX flows and global supply chains. Consumers also need access to liquid, widely used tokens on regulated local trading venues. Without collaboration, the vacuum will be filled either by unregulated offshore actors or by fragmented national systems that cut themselves off from global liquidity, utility, and economic activity.\n\nTwo decades ago, regulators resisted carving the internet into national intranets — and the open web flourished. Today we face the monetary sequel. Stablecoins can finish what the internet started: making value itself as open, programmable, and global as information.\n\nIf the EU, U.S., and other jurisdictions seize this moment to build recognition and reciprocity, stablecoins will become the backbone of real-time, global commerce and usher in a new era of global economic prosperity through the frictionless cross-border exchange of value.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Decentralized oracle network Chainlink is working with 24 of the world’s largest financial institutions to overhaul how corporate actions, such as dividends, stock splits, and mergers, are processed across global markets.\n\nChainlink ran a pilot with SWIFT, DTCC, Euroclear and six other financial institutions. It leveraged a combination of its blockchain-based and artificial intelligence (AI) to ingest and validate real corporate action events in multiple languages.\n\nThat led to the production of unified data containers, known as golden records, in near real time, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nThese records were distributed simultaneously to blockchain networks and legacy systems like the interbank messaging system SWIFT, significantly reducing manual work and the risk of error.\n\nThe process used a blend of large language models, including OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude, to extract structured data from unstructured corporate action announcements. These were then published as unified gold records on-chain to create a “single source of truth that all participants can easily access, verify, and build upon.”\n\nChainlink’s Runtime Environment (CRE) validated model outputs, while its interoperability protocol (CCIP) relayed data to blockchains, including Avalanche and DTCC’s private network.\n\nData attesters cryptographically attested the outputs and contributed to potentially missing data fields. According to Chainlink, the system achieved a near 100% data consensus across all test events.\n\nThe current system for processing corporate actions is costly. Citi’s 2025 Asset Servicing report shows that the average corporate action touches 110,000 interactions and costs $34 million to process. The global financial industry is now spending an estimated $58 billion annually in processing corporate actions.\n\nMore For You\n\nAvalanche, CruTrade Tokenize $60M of Collectable Bottles of Fine Wine\n\nThe Avalanche-powered marketplace launches with 200,000 bottles tokenized to cut costs and prevent spoilage in the $9B fine wine market\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "HBAR displayed notable resilience in the past 24-hour trading window, oscillating within a narrow range of $0.2104 to $0.2172. The most significant movement emerged late on Sept. 28, when the token surged from $0.2139 to $0.2168 on volume nearly double the daily average. This sharp rise established clear resistance near $0.2172 as trading activity spiked to 59.92 million tokens, underscoring heightened market participation.\n\nFollowing this upswing, HBAR entered a consolidation phase, stabilizing between $0.2144 and $0.2168 before retreating to $0.2131 by midday Sept. 29. The asset found reliable support at that level, subsequently rebounding to $0.2160, highlighting steady demand. Late-session activity saw another bullish burst, with prices climbing from $0.2132 to $0.2164 within an hour, supported by strong volume flows that reinforced momentum.\n\nThe rally comes against a backdrop of heightened market uncertainty, where digital assets like HBAR have attracted institutional attention.

Rather than retreating after last week’s liquidations, leveraged longs are back in force,” the firm’s market insights team said in a Monday update.\n\nThe team highlighted that cumulative open interest in BTC perpetuals worldwide has increased from $42.8 billion to $43.6 billion. While modest, this increase reflects renewed capital inflows.\n\nMeanwhile, annualized funding rates on leading platforms such as Deribit have jumped to 13%. Positive rates indicate that holders of long positions are willing to pay a fee to shorts to keep their positions open.\n\n“Hyperliquid’s long bias is also climbing back to 57%, up from just 36% last week,” the team added.\n\nInvestors’ willingness to pay double-digit funding rates demonstrates growing conviction that prices will continue to rise during the historically bullish fourth quarter.\n\nThe data also suggest that last week’s volatility did not significantly shake investor confidence. BTC’s price declined in the first four days of the previous week, with the sharpest drop below $109,000 occurring on Thursday.\n\nThe sell-off led to over $700 million in liquidations of leveraged long positions—the largest single-day figure in at least six months, according to Coinglass.\n\nBitcoin's price has since recovered to trade near $114,000.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Stellar’s native token XLM posted a strong rally over the past 24 hours, climbing 3.7% from $0.36 to $0.37 on heavy trading activity. The move was fueled by two distinct breakout phases: an evening surge on September 28 at 22:00 that carried prices to $0.37 on volume nearly double the daily average, followed by a secondary push at 13:00 the next day that reinforced bullish momentum. Both sessions were supported by elevated volumes above 31 million units, signaling broad market participation.\n\nThe final hour of trading on September 29 proved particularly explosive, with XLM advancing 1.64% between 13:10 and 14:09. A breakout began at 13:42, marked by a sharp volume spike exceeding 1.9 million units on a single candle. That surge carried the price through resistance at $0.366, establishing a fresh uptrend channel. XLM went on to touch intraday highs near $0.372 before consolidating just below at $0.371 as volumes tapered off.\n\nMomentum for Stellar’s token comes as the project continues expanding its footprint in the Asia-Pacific region. Stellar has been strengthening its cross-border payment partnerships with Southeast Asian banks while developing Soroban, its smart-contract platform designed to broaden the network’s capabilities. These moves align with increasing adoption of blockchain-based payment infrastructure within traditional finance, particularly for international transfer systems.\n\nWith XLM still trading under the $1.00 threshold, the token has also drawn retail traders who view lower-priced digital assets as accessible entry points into blockchain ecosystems. Combined with the institutional interest highlighted by the high-volume breakouts, Stellar’s recent performance underscores its positioning as both a retail-friendly token and a serious contender in cross-border financial innovation.\n\nTechnical Indicators Signal Continued Strength\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "In a bold shift for Solana’s\nSOL\n$219.91\nscaling roadmap, Jump Crypto’s Firedancer development team has submitted a proposal, known as SIMD-0370, that would remove the block-level compute unit limit.\n\nThe change, which the team suggested would be implemented following the deployment of the Alpenglow upgrade, could unlock a new regime of throughput by letting block producers have bigger blocks.\n\nUnder today’s design, each block is bounded by a maximum allowable compute units, a safety measure and maximum workload meant to stop validators from getting overwhelmed. Currently, the limit on Solana is at 60 million compute-units. Earlier this year, another group of Solana core developers submitted a paper arguing to lift the limit to 100 million compute-units.\n\nBut with the upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, some developers say that cap is no longer necessary. And if that cap is lifted, blocks would be able to fit as many transaction they can, depending on how high performing their validators are.\n\nSupporters say this flexibility could make Solana more resilient during periods of high demand, such as when new tokens launch or DeFi activity spikes. Bigger blocks would mean more transactions can get through, reducing the kinds of congestion and failed trades that frustrate users.\n\nStill, some debated that blocks today on Solana aren't full so there would be no tangible difference for end users. “We haven't had any time where demand would spike median fees or average fees significantly. So it's not even clear that burst capacity would be meaningful,” wrote Anatoly Yakovenko, the founder of the Solana blockchain, on the developer proposal forum.\n\nThe proposal is still in the discussion stage, and the Solana community will need to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks. If approved, it could mark a new chapter in Solana’s scaling story.\n\nRead more: Solana Eyes 66% Block Size Bump With New Developer Proposal as Network Demand Grows\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Solana Eyes 66% Block Size Bump With New Developer Proposal as Network Demand Grows",
    "content": "Solana developers are considering increasing the network’s block capacity by 66% as demand for block space on the most widely used network grows.\n\nA new proposal, SIMD-0286, floats the idea of increasing Solana’s per-block compute limit from 60 million to 100 million compute units (CUs), according to a document posted by core contributors this week.\n\nThe goal is to let Solana process more transactions and support heavier apps like DEXs, MEV systems, and restaking protocols without hitting compute ceilings.\n\n\"Block limits' primary purpose is to ensure the vast majority of network participants are able to keep up with the network, by restricting the amount of work a leader is allowed to pack into a block,\" the proposal's motivation reads.\n\n\"However, current mainnet traffic is largely not constrained by large block execution times. This proposal aims a substantial increase in block limits to 100 million CUs, in order to provide additional capacity to the network,\" it adds.\n\nSolana currently produces blocks every 400 milliseconds, with strict caps on how much compute can be packed into each one. Earlier this month, the network activated SIMD-0256, which increased the limit from 50 million to 60 million CUs.\n\nBut developer demand has spiked in tandem, raising the need for even more block space. The new proposal would allow validators to opt into the 100 million CU ceiling via a software upgrade, which is expected to go live in a future epoch once it is adopted.\n\nSIMD-0286 only raises the Max Block Units limit, which governs total compute per block. Other limits, such as Max Writable Account Units, stay unchanged.\n\nThis means the extra capacity will primarily benefit non-vote, parallelizable transactions such as DeFi swaps or NFT mints, without increasing pressure on individual accounts.\n\nRead more: Solana Breaks $200 as Jito’s BAM Draws Bullish Bets\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "CruTrade, a new marketplace built on the Avalanche blockchain, has launched with more than $60 million worth of tokenized fine wine, marking what it calls the world’s largest live pool of on-chain luxury assets.\n\nThe platform brings over 200,000 bottles from 250 producers — most of whom are verified in Burgundy — to collectors who can now trade ownership instantly while the bottles remain safely stored.\n\nThe $9 billion secondary wine market has long struggled with high fees, slow trades, and spoilage from poor storage. CruTrade addresses those problems by keeping bottles in professional storage and transferring ownership digitally. Each bottle is verified by RFID and recorded on-chain, providing a permanent, transparent record of provenance.\n\nCollectors can trade fine wine as easily as digital assets, while producers remain connected to their bottles and protected from mishandling. “We built CruTrade to do one thing well: protect the wine in every bottle,” said CEO Devon Ferreira.\n\nThe platform’s debut partnership with Crurated gives it immediate scale. Crurated has already tokenized more than $60 million in wine, allowing CruTrade to bypass the early liquidity challenges that limit many real-world asset projects.\n\nBuilt on Avalanche, known for its speed and low fees, CruTrade aims to make fine wine more accessible while maintaining authenticity. The company plans to expand its service to bonded warehouses globally and to restaurants, where diners could order rare wines directly from digital menus.\n\nBy blending blockchain verification with traditional cellar discipline, CruTrade offers collectors a faster, safer way to trade bottles that might otherwise sit untouched.\n\nMore For You\n\nCoinflow Raises $25M to Scale Stablecoin Payments, Backed by Pantera and Coinbase\n\nThe company says it has grown revenue 23-fold since 2024 and now supports stablecoin-powered payments in over 170 countries.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Tom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital",
    "content": "Kerrisdale Capital has taken a short position in BitMine Immersion (BMNR), the ether-focused digital asset treasury firm led by Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, calling its business model a relic of a bygone crypto era.\n\nIn a detailed report published Wednesday, the well-known short-seller said BitMine’s strategy mirrors that of Strategy (MSTR) — issuing shares at a premium to buy crypto and grow token-per-share metrics — but argued that market conditions no longer support that model.\n\n“BMNR is chasing a model that is on its way to extinction,” Kerrisdale wrote. “Scarcity and meme-like enthusiasm once kept premiums high despite constant dilution, but those conditions have vanished.”\n\nKerrisdale months ago shorted Strategy against a long in bitcoin, noting that company's premium to net asset value was not sustainable. The trade thus far has proven quite profitable.\n\nLas Vegas-based Bitmine has undergone a dramatic pivot over the past year, transforming from a niche bitcoin miner into an ether-heavy corporate treasury. With Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee as executive chairman, BitMine has raised over $10 billion since July 2025, primarily through at-the-market (ATM) stock sales, and acquired more than 2.8 million ETH.\n\nThe stock — after rocketing from about $5 to more than $100 on the launch of its ether treasury strategy — has pulled back to around $58 in its latest trades.\n\nKerrisdale said the pace of that stock issuance, roughly $170 million per day, has “turned early enthusiasm into fatigue.” The report criticized BitMine’s latest $365 million equity raise, marketed as a premium deal, as a “discounted giveaway” once warrant terms are factored in.\n\nThe firm also took aim at Lee himself, saying his presence lacks the gravitational pull needed to maintain investor confidence. “Tom Lee brings name recognition as a strategist and television commentator, but he does not command the kind of cult-like following that turned Michael Saylor into a meme-stock icon,” the report said.\n\nWhile Kerrisdale said it remains bullish on ether, it sees no justification for paying a premium through intermediaries like BitMine. “If you want ETH, just buy it directly,” the firm wrote.\n\nAdding to the pressure is a flood of new competition. Over 150 U.S.-listed firms are reportedly planning $100 billion in crypto treasury offerings, and a coming wave of Ethereum ETFs is expected to offer lower-cost and more transparent exposure.\n\nKerrisdale said BitMine’s disclosures have grown increasingly opaque. ETH-per-share growth has slowed sharply in recent months, even as token holdings rose. “The reflexive loop that every DAT relies on had begun to stall,” the firm wrote, noting that BitMine’s market premium fell from 2.0x in August to around 1.2x in October.\n\n“The strategy is generic, the competition is mushrooming, disclosures have grown opaque, ETH-per-share has slowed,” Kerrisdale concluded. “BMNR’s premium is destined to sink.”\n\nA representative for Bitmine did not respond to a request for comment. Shares of the company are lower by 2% Wednesday.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin and Ether ETFs Saw Big Inflows Tuesday as Investors Bought Dip\n\nThe spot bitcoin funds drew in nearly $900 million, while the ether ETFs pulled more than $400 million.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Crypto treasury firms that stockpile tokens could evolve from speculative wrappers into long-run economic engines for blockchains, argues Syncracy Capital co-founder Ryan Watkins.\n\nDigital asset treasury (DAT) firms are publicly traded companies that raise capital to acquire and manage crypto on their balance sheets.\n\nIn a Sept. 23 blog post and an accompanying thread on X, Watkins said DATs already hold roughly $105 billion in assets across bitcoin, ether and other majors, a scale that few market participants have fully considered.\n\nHis core claim: a small number of these firms may mature into durable operators that help finance, govern and build within the networks whose tokens they hold.\n\nWatkins said most attention has fixated on near-term trading dynamics — premiums to net asset value, fundraising announcements and “what’s the next token”—which misses the larger arc.\n\n“We imagine select DATs becoming for-profit, publicly traded counterparts to crypto foundations, but with broader mandates to deploy capital, operate businesses, and participate in governance,” he wrote.\n\nBecause some DATs already control meaningful slices of token supply, their treasuries can be more than vaults; they can be policy and product levers inside ecosystems.\n\nHe pointed to crypto-native examples where scale matters: on Solana, RPC providers and proprietary market makers that stake more SOL can improve transaction landing and spread capture; on Hyperliquid, front ends that stake more HYPE can lower user fees or increase take rates without raising costs.\n\nAccess to large, permanent pools of native assets can help such businesses bootstrap and scale, he said.\n\nWatkins contrasted these plays with MicroStrategy’s bitcoin-only strategy, which is largely about capital structure around a non-programmable asset.\n\nHe went on to say that by comparison, tokens on smart contract platforms — ETH, SOL, HYPE — are programmable and can be put to work on-chain.\n\nDATs holding them can stake for fees, supply liquidity, lend, participate in governance and acquire “ecosystem primitives” such as validators, RPC nodes or indexers, turning treasuries into yield-generating balance sheets.\n\nStructurally, he likened winning DATs to a hybrid of familiar models: the permanent capital of closed-end funds and REITs, the balance-sheet orientation of banks, and the compounding ethos of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nWhat makes them distinct, he said, is that returns accrue in crypto per share rather than via management fees, making the vehicles closer to pure plays on underlying networks than to traditional asset managers.\n\nHe argued that tools like common equity, convertibles and preferreds give DATs flexible funding to expand balance sheets, while on-chain yields can help manage that funding over time.\n\nWatkins cautioned that “not all DATs will make it.”\n\nHe expects many first-generation vehicles—those heavy on financial engineering and light on operating substance — to fade as conditions normalize. As competition intensifies, he anticipates consolidation, experiments with more exotic financing and, at times, reckless balance-sheet moves if premiums flip to discounts and pressure builds.\n\nIn his view, the survivors will be those that pair disciplined capital allocation with operating chops, recycling cash flows into token accumulation, product building and ecosystem expansion. “Over time, the best managed ones could evolve into the Berkshire Hathaways of their blockchains,” he wrote.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Crypto credit firm Maple Finance and Elwood Technologies are joining forces to make it easier for large financial institutions to enter digital asset credit markets. The companies announced Monday that Maple’s on-chain lending and asset management platform will link up with Elwood’s execution, portfolio management, and risk tools.\n\nMaple, founded in 2021, specializes in structured lending products and yield strategies built on public blockchains. Elwood, the trading company backed by hedge-fund manager Alan Howard, provides connectivity to global crypto exchanges, custodians and fund administrators, along with analytics and risk monitoring tools for institutional investors.\n\nThe collaboration targets a key friction point for traditional players. Banks and asset managers looking to diversify into digital assets face fragmented infrastructure and operational hurdles. By combining Maple’s lending expertise with Elwood’s institutional trading and risk systems, the firms aim to create a framework that mirrors what professional investors expect in traditional markets.\n\nSid Powell, Maple’s CEO, said the partnership will extend “institutional-grade” access to on-chain credit opportunities. Elwood CEO Chris Lawn added that credit markets are an essential piece of crypto’s evolution and need the same type of infrastructure as other asset classes.\n\nThe move comes as demand for tokenized credit and fixed-income products grows. For example, Ripple and Credbull recently launched initiatives that bring U.S. Treasuries and private credit onto blockchain rails. Maple and Elwood’s tie-up underscores how service providers are trying to position themselves as gateways for institutional capital entering the decentralized economy.\n\nMore For You\n\nAvalanche, CruTrade Tokenize $60M of Collectable Bottles of Fine Wine\n\nThe Avalanche-powered marketplace launches with 200,000 bottles tokenized to cut costs and prevent spoilage in the $9B fine wine market\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Quatrefoil Data Services, a firm on a mission to provide institutional-grade benchmarks for digital assets, starting with a reference rate for Ethereum staking, has rolled out operations, the firm said on Monday\n\nIts flagship product, the Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR), measures yields from Ethereum validators and is designed to function as crypto’s equivalent of a “risk-free rate.”\n\nCESR was created by investment firm CoinFund and is already distributed by CoinDesk Indices. Asset managers and protocols including Coinbase and FalconX rely on it to design products and manage risk.\n\nBenchmarks are a core feature of traditional markets, underpinning everything from futures to insurance. Without reliable standards, the crypto industry has struggled to create regulated financial products.\n\nQuatrefoil aims to fill that gap. The company has also secured a U.S. patent for its benchmark methodology and is developing new indices for Solana, Avalanche, liquid staking tokens, and stablecoin lending.\n\nTo strengthen its policy expertise, Quatrefoil has brought on former CFTC Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo as an advisor. Giancarlo, known for his push to modernize U.S. derivatives regulation, said the firm is well-positioned to deliver “high impact” benchmarks to power the next generation of crypto-linked financial products.\n\nCEO Finbarr Hutcheson, a former Goldman Sachs executive and ex-CEO of ICE Clear Europe, said the benchmarks will help bring transparency and scalability to digital assets. CoinFund’s Christopher Perkins, who helped design CESR, added that such standards could eventually support trillions of dollars in products as institutional adoption deepens.\n\nMore For You\n\nAvalanche, CruTrade Tokenize $60M of Collectable Bottles of Fine Wine\n\nThe Avalanche-powered marketplace launches with 200,000 bottles tokenized to cut costs and prevent spoilage in the $9B fine wine market\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "AllUnity, a German regulated e-money institution backed by DWS, Flow Traders, and Galaxy, and issuer of the EURAU euro stablecoin, has partnered with Privy, the crypto wallet infrastructure firm owned by Stripe.\n\nThe move enables fintechs, e-commerce platforms, and enterprises to embed EURAU wallets directly into their applications. Users could then pay, receive, or hold digital euros, with the option to convert between stablecoins and fiat, the companies said on Monday.\n\nThe integration also supports programmable treasury tools. For example, a business could automate payroll in EURAU or handle supplier payouts in real time, reducing reliance on traditional banking rails. Companies may also earn decentralized finance (DeFi) yield on idle balances, though such opportunities remain experimental, according to a press release.\n\nThe deal positions EURAU within Stripe’s broader crypto ecosystem, giving it exposure to payments infrastructure already used by millions of merchants. While most stablecoins in circulation track the U.S. dollar, this partnership brings a regulated euro option into mainstream payment flows.\n\nAlexander Höptner, CEO of AllUnity, said the partnership “marks a significant milestone in the broader adoption of EURAU,” while Privy CEO Henri Stern emphasized that euro-based stablecoin use has been underdeveloped compared to dollar offerings.\n\nThe agreement signals growing interest in euro-denominated digital money as European regulators prepare to enforce MiCAR, the EU’s comprehensive crypto framework, in 2026.

    "content": "Analysts mapped a slow-grind path for bitcoin and flagged $112,000 as the trigger while gold advocate Peter Schiff revived the gold-versus-bitcoin debate by challenging Michael Saylor’s BTC treasury bet for his firm.\n\nCoinDesk Senior Analyst James van Straten said bitcoin’s market structure has shifted alongside gold’s repricing.\n\nHe expects a slow, stair-step advance supported by steady ETF inflows, with 10–20% pullbacks along the way. He compared the setup to gold in the early 2000s, when prices climbed for years but often paused for healthy corrections.\n\nIn his framing, bitcoin may sometimes lag gold and sometimes outperform it, yet he still sees bitcoin leading on total returns over a full cycle.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Trails Equities, Metals, and USD in Q3. Here Is a Key Level to Watch for Next Move\n\nMichaël van de Poppe focused on near-term levels.\n\nHe called sub-$107,000 a buy zone, signaling where he thinks dip buyers are likely to step in. He also pointed to $112,000 as the ceiling to beat. A clean break and hold above $112,000 on UTC closes would, in his view, confirm strength and broaden risk appetite, the point at which flows often rotate into large altcoins. That is what he means by “altcoin mode.”\n\nEuro Capital CEO Peter Schiff, meanwhile, challenged Michael Saylor’s strategy by contrasting Strategy’s bitcoin exposure with a hypothetical gold program.\n\nHis core claim is liquidity. He argued that tens of billions of dollars in gold could be sold with limited market impact, while trying to exit a similar bitcoin position could hit prices hard and set off copycat selling.\n\nSupporters of bitcoin would counter that any large seller could stage exits over time and use over-the-counter channels, but Schiff’s point is that gold’s market depth offers more flexibility to very large holders.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "From SPACs to Cash-Flow Buys: How DATs Are Plotting the Next Growth Phase",
    "content": "The world of Digital Asset Treasury (DATs) has entered a new era, after Strive (ASST) announced an all-stock deal to acquire Semler Scientific (SMLR) this week.\n\nThe deal marked the first merger of two publicly traded bitcoin treasuries, and according to a Wall Street banker familiar with the situation, this is just the start of a massive consolidation wave among the DATs.\n\nThe banker, who opted to remain anonymous, outlined three scenarios for how DATS may evolve.\n\nThe first of the three paths is the DAT-to-DAT mergers.\n\nStrive’s acquisition of Semler is the first clear example of unifying BTC holdings, boosting bitcoin per share, and establishing governance under one roof, the banker said.\n\nWhen it closes, the deal will create a new company that will hold nearly 11,000 BTC after Strive’s simultaneous $675 million purchase of 5,885 coins.\n\nIt's worth noting that Semler’s shares had been trading below the value of its bitcoin, effectively assigning negative value to its medical device business. For Strive, the acquisition consolidates balance sheets, adds BTC scale, and pushes forward a key company metric: Bitcoin per share.\n\n“Strive’s merger announcement is accretive in bitcoin per share, meeting our short-term goal,” CEO Matt Cole wrote on X.\n\n“We believe the combined power of the entities will give the combined company more ability to access the capital markets in a way that will drive increased bitcoin per share and accretion in a way neither could do on their own.”\n\nWith the bitcoin treasury market being saturated with many publicly traded companies, this strategy is likely to be one of the most efficient ways to grow for the DATs.\n\nThe banker said the second path of evolution is acquiring cash-flowing businesses to offset dilution and fund ongoing BTC purchases.\n\nMetaplanet, Japan’s largest bitcoin holder, has already said it will use its treasury to buy cash-generating businesses as part of its “phase two” strategy.\n\nMetaplanet is also exploring the use of perpetual preferred stock, a financing strategy that Strategy (MSTR) has already employed, allowing it to buy bitcoin without diluting shareholders through at-the-market (ATM) common stock offerings.\n\nThird, is merging with legitimate businesses instead of using special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), according to the banker.\n\nSPACs are shell firms designed to take companies public quickly, but the “de-SPAC” process can be messy, requiring shareholder votes, regulatory filings, and often suffering from investor redemptions. Making things more complex, to bridge funding gaps, many SPACs rely on PIPEs (private investments in public equity), which bring dilution, discounts and uncertainty.\n\nFor DATs, merging directly with a company that already has operations and governance avoids these pitfalls.\n\nThe bottom line is that DATs are at a point where they need to evolve and get creative with their growth strategies.\n\nIn fact, other companies are already catching on to this trend. Recently, FRNT Financial (TSXV: FRNT), a digital asset investment bank, said it has entered into a consulting agreement with an undisclosed DAT with $100 million worth of digital assets in its balance sheet.\n\nAccording to the deal terms, FRNT will help evaluate and structure lending opportunities for the company's next growth phase.\n\nThe deals, such as the Strive-Semler merger, show digital asset treasury companies will need to scale through consolidation, buy profitable businesses, or align with established operators that bring legitimacy, ushering in the next phase of DATs' evolution.\n\nRead more: Semler Scientific Still Has Nearly 170% Upside After Strive Buyout Deal: Benchmark\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Tether and Circle Are ‘Printing Money’ but Competition Is Coming: Wormhole Co-Founder",
    "content": "Stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle are profiting from the current high-interest rate environment while stablecoin holders see none of the returns, said Wormhole’s co-founder, Dan Reecer, at Mercado Bitcoin’s DAC 2025 event.\n\nSpeaking as a panelist, he said the companies are effectively “printing money” by keeping the yield from the U.S. Treasuries backing their tokens. Tether, for example, reported $4.9 billion in net profit in the second quarter of the year. That has seen the company’s valuation soar to a reported $500 billion in a new funding round.\n\nAs interest rates remain elevated, Reecer suggested it’s only a matter of time before users expect a share of that yield or move their funds elsewhere.\n\nPlatforms like M^0 and Agora are already responding to that demand, he suggested. These projects allow stablecoin infrastructure to be built in a way that routes yield to applications or directly to end users, instead of the issuer capturing all of it.\n\n“If I’m holding USDC, I’m losing money, losing money that Circle is making,” Reecer said in the session, referring to the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding token that’s backed by U.S. Treasuries generating income.\n\nTether and Circle likely do not share the yield generated from their stablecoins directly with users as doing so could draw the ire of regulators. An alternative that’s steadily growing are money market funds, which allow investors to gain exposure to the yield behind these stablecoins.\n\nCircle, it’s worth noting, acquired Hashnote earlier this year for $1.3 billion, the issuer of the tokenized money market fund USYC. With this acquisition, Circle aims to enable convertibility between cash and yield-bearing collateral on blockchains.\n\nThese money market funds, however, are still a fraction of the stablecoin market. According to RWA.xyz data, their market capitalization currently stands around $7.3 billion, while the global stablecoin market has topped $290 billion.\n\nA Tether spokesperson told CoinDesk that “USDT’s role is clear: it is a digital dollar, not an investment product.” He added that “hundreds of millions of people” rely on USDT, especially in emerging markets, “where it serves as a lifeline against inflation, banking instability, and capital controls.”\n\n“While few percentage points might make the difference for rich Americans or Europeans, the real savings for our USDT user base is the one against dramatic inflation so common in developing countries - often reaching numbers as high as 50% to 90% year-over-year, with declines of local currency values against the US dollar at 70% year-over-year,” he said.\n\n“Passing along yield would fundamentally change a stablecoin's nature, risk profile, and regulatory treatment,” the spokesperson added. “Competitors experimenting with yield-bearing stablecoins are targeting a completely different audience, and they take on additional risks.”\n\nFireblocks' Stephen Richardson, during the panel, said the broader stablecoin market is meanwhile evolving toward real-world use cases, including cross-border payments and FX services.\n\nHe pointed out that tokenized money moving instantly could help solve problems that exist today, such as slow corporate payment rails or expensive remittances. Financial innovation, Richardson added, is already being seen in the sector, with an example being tokenized money market funds that are being used as collateral on exchanges.\n\nMore For You\n\nAvalanche, CruTrade Tokenize $60M of Collectable Bottles of Fine Wine\n\nThe Avalanche-powered marketplace launches with 200,000 bottles tokenized to cut costs and prevent spoilage in the $9B fine wine market\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

That's the difference between its prices when the CME market closed for the week on Friday and reopened on Sunday.\n\nEther\nETH\n$4,456.68\nis showing a similar setup. That has gained 3.4% and left a futures gap starting around $4,000.\n\nThe thing about CME futures gaps is that they tend to get filled. With the two largest cryptocurrencies currently trading higher, that means they both — at some point — are likely to drop back and retest those lower levels.\n\nBitcoin’s monthly low often tends to occur within the first 10 trading days, meaning this dip could arrive within the next two weeks. That's even though October, often referred to as “Uptober,” is historically its second-best performing month with an average return of 22%.\n\nMore broadly, the CoinDesk 20 Index has gained 3.2% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green.\n\nOutside of crypto, precious metals remain firm, with gold climbing 1.5% on Monday to $3,815 and silver approaching all time highs at $47, with the next breakout level at $50.\n\nMacro markets are focused on Friday’s highly influential U.S. jobs report, with nonfarm payrolls, a measure of new jobs excluding farm work and certain categories, expected at 39,000 alongside a steady 4.3% unemployment rate. ISM Services PMI is forecast at 52, indicating continued expansion of the world's largest economy.\n\nFor bitcoin to break out of its current $110,000 to $120,000 trading range, volatility and sentiment will need to return. The fourth quarter, which starts on Wednesday, could provide the catalyst.

    "title": "IBIT’s Options Market Fuels Bitcoin ETF Dominance, Report Suggests",
    "content": "Analyst James Check and Unchained produced a report on the current bitcoin\nBTC\n$111,480.33\nmarket landscape, with the most interesting takeaway being the rise of the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) specifically the success of iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the options market that now underpins the product.\n\nThe report opens with a quote saying: \"Options are now the dominant derivatives instrument by open interest, being over $90 Billion in size, and eclipsing the futures markets at $80 Billion\".\n\nSince its launch in January 2024, IBIT has seen around $61 billion in net inflows over 18 months, making it one of the most successful ETF's of all-time.\n\nHowever, the dominance accelerated following the launch of ETF options in November 2024.\n\nThe options market, which gives investors the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a set price within a certain timeframe, has dramatically reshaped flows, with IBIT attracting $32.8 billion in inflows while competitors have remained flat since the options began trading.\n\nThe report states that IBIT now controls 57.5% of all bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM), up from 49% in October 2024, with roughly 40 cents of options open interest for every dollar of bitcoin held in the fund. By contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC, the second largest ETF, is about 25 times smaller than IBIT in options open interest, with around $1.3 billion.\n\nThis level of activity has made IBIT a rival to Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchanges, where daily trading volumes typically run between $4 billion and $5 billion, according to the report.\n\nThe report also points to 13F filings, the quarterly disclosures required by the SEC for investment managers with over $100 million in assets. These filings show institutions holding ETFs, allowing others to use the options market to be able to short or use arbitrage methods for hedging volatility.\n\nOverall, the report concludes that bitcoin’s volatility profile has shifted meaningfully in this cycle, with ETFs and their options markets serving as a major driver of that change.\n\n\"In our view, the launch of options on top of the spot ETFs is thus far an under-discussed, but highly important change in Bitcoin’s recent market structure\", the report said.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Avalanche's AVAX Extends Weekly Losses to 18% as Institutional Backing Fails to Lift Market",
    "content": "Avalanche’s native token AVAX fell 8% over the past 24 hours to $27.72, extending a weeklong slide that erased nearly 18% of its value. The drop occurred alongside a broad plunge in crypto markets that's seen ETH, SOL, DOGE also post double-digit percentage declines over the past week and BTC fall 6%.\n\nAVAX has struggled to break above a resistance level of $30.28 and found only weak support near $27.65. CoinDesk Analytics data shows trading volume sank to 121,896 tokens in early trading Friday, signaling that institutional selling may be slowing but has not yet reversed.\n\nThe price slump comes in the wake of Avalanche-aligned corporate initiatives aimed at deepening institutional engagement. Earlier this week, tech company AgriFORCE Growing Systems rebranded as AVAX One and announce plans to raise $550 million to acquire and hold AVAX. The move would make it the first Nasdaq-listed company to focus exclusively on Avalanche’s ecosystem.\n\nThe firm assembled a high-profile advisory team led by SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci and Coinbase Institutional’s Brett Tejpaul, positioning itself as a major AVAX custodian. AVAX One aims to hold more than $700 million in the token, a bid to cement its role as a central figure in Avalanche’s growth story.\n\nBut for now, the market hasn’t bought in.\n\nThe falling price suggests that institutional backers may still be cautious about Avalanche’s long-term positioning. While regulatory approvals for token-related vehicles are pending, they have yet to translate into buying momentum.\n\nAvalanche’s roadmap includes partnerships and enterprise use cases, but these fundamentals have yet to counterbalance the current selling pressure.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Luke Dashjr Denies Hard Fork Claims as Bitcoin Governance Debate Heats Up",
    "content": "Debates over Bitcoin’s future are nothing new, but this week the discussion took on a sharper edge. One of Bitcoin’s long-serving developers was at the center of a storm about immutability, censorship and what it means to “save” the protocol.\n\nThe controversy escalated on Sept. 25, following an article published by The Rage claiming to reveal that Luke Dashjr, maintainer of the Bitcoin Knots software, advocates a hard fork that would install a trusted multisig committee with power to retroactively alter the blockchain, review transactions and remove illicit content.\n\nA blockchain hard fork is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain software, requiring all participants to upgrade to the new protocol because the new and old versions are incompatible.\n\nThe piece cited purported leaked text messages in which Dashjr allegedly warned: “Either Bitcoin dies or we have to trust someone.”\n\nThe story spread across X, drawing hundreds of thousands of views and intensifying a long-running philosophical rift: should Bitcoin remain a neutral settlement layer, or should developers actively filter what counts as legitimate use of the network?\n\nDashjr rejected the claims outright. “The truth is I have not proposed a hardfork or anything of the sort, and these bad actors are just grasping at straws to slander me and try to undermine my efforts to save Bitcoin again,” he wrote.\n\nThe Rage responded with a meme to the effect of demanding to know who sent the leaked messages that its story shared.\n\nDashjr repeated his position multiple times over the following 24 hours. “Nope, nothing changed. Nobody is calling for a hard fork still.\" he posted. In another reply, he underlined: “There is no hard fork.”\n\nBehind the dispute lies a deeper divide between Dashjr’s Bitcoin Knots project and the broader Bitcoin Core software used by most of the network.\n\nKnots enforces tighter transaction policies, including blocking non-financial data such as Ordinals inscriptions and Runes tokens. Dashjr and his supporters argue such measures protect Bitcoin’s monetary integrity and safeguard it from regulatory risks. Core developers have historically taken a more permissive approach, tolerating non-standard data as long as it does not break consensus.\n\nThe alleged hard fork proposal cut to the heart of that tension. For Dashjr’s critics, it seemed to confirm fears that his vision requires compromising Bitcoin’s principle of immutability. For his defenders, the leak was an opportunistic smear designed to derail the case for stronger spam filters.\n\nAmong his defenders was Udi Wertheimer, co-founder of Taproot Wizards, a Bitcoin Ordinals project, so one which most would assume embodies everyting to which Dashjr is opposed.\n\n“Not a Luke fan but this is a hit piece and fake news. He is not proposing this,” Wertheimer posted on X, referring to the supposed hard fork plan.\n\n\"I'm (obviously) not on Luke's side but...this is just a sloppy low quality propaganda piece,\" he wrote.\n\nWertheimer concluded that what Dasjhr's leaked messages were a hypothetical discussion about using zero-knowledge proofs to allowing Knots nodes to avoid downloading \"spam.\"\n\n\"This is, as always, a nothing burger,\" he concluded. \"It's pretty obvious to me that this proposal never gets implemented, and even if it did, it does not censor the network and does not split the network, and remains fully compatible with core.\"\n\nIt’s worth noting that over the past 24 hours, bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,426.36\nslipped 2.2% to trade at around $109,000, a drop of over 5.5% in the last week.\n\nWhile there’s no direct evidence linking this dip to the controversy over Dashjr’s alleged plans, the timing is hardly helpful. In crypto markets, uncertainty alone can amplify downward pressure and rumors of protocol upheaval tend to stoke exactly that.\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Riot Platforms (RIOT) picked up back-to-back upgrades from Wall Street on Friday, with JPMorgan and Citigroup both raising their outlooks on the bitcoin miner amid changing industry economics and a shift toward high-performance computing.\n\nJPMorgan boosted Riot to overweight from neutral and raised its price target to $19 from $15, calling it the most attractive among its mining peers. Citi upgraded to buy from neutral and lifted its price target to $24 from $13.75. Both firms pointed to Riot’s pivot into artificial intelligence and cloud services as a potential growth driver as mining profits tighten. Riot was modestly outperforming a sharply lower sector on Friday, declining \"just\" 1.2% to $16.55.\n\nAlongside its upgrade of RIOT, JPMorgan downgraded the previously very hot-handed IREN to underweight from neutral. Shares are down 9.7% on Friday, but still higher by 300% year-to-date. CleanSpark (CLSK) was cut to neutral and it's lower by 9.3% Friday and higher by 34% year-to-date.\n\nThe bank maintained its buy rating on Cipher Mining (CIFR), and doubled its price target to $12 from $6. The shares were 3.5% lower to $11.20 at publication time.\n\nMARA Holdings (MARA) was kept at overweight, with a reduced price objective of $20, down from $22. The stock was 1% lower around $15.90 in early trading.\n\nJPMorgan’s analysts are assigning a 50% probability that Riot, Cipher, and IREN each secure near-term high performance computing (HPC) colocation agreements, using Core Scientific’s (CORZ) 800 MW CoreWeave (CRWV) deal as a benchmark.

    "content": "The United Nations leaned into blockchain technology to overhaul its own pension system, and a study of that process concluded the innovation is the \"ultimate technology for digital identity verification,\" which has spurred the UN toward extending the system and sharing it with other international groups.\n\nThe UN — which has explored various blockchain uses over the years — tried it out on their United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), according to a white paper released this week that suggested its use in confirming people's identities can help in security, efficiency and transparency. In cooperation with the Hyperledger Foundation, the UN sought to \"improve and secure the UN pension process globally by putting a blockchain-supported digital identification infrastructure into production.\"\n\nThe UN pension fund had been working off of a 70-year-old system to identify beneficiaries in 190 countries, relying on a paper-based approach to prove more than 70,000 beneficiaries were who they said they were, still alive and where they claimed to be. It was prone to error and abuse, and resulted in about 1,400 payment suspensions every year, according to the document. So the organization shifted to the blockchain-powered digital certification, beginning with a 2020 pilot program and a 2021 implementation.\n\n\"The shift away from physical documentation has substantially reduced processing times previously spent on receiving, opening, scanning, and archiving paper documents,\" the paper said.\n\nThe blockchain helped eliminate the single-point-of-failure problem posed by a centrally managed approach, according to the paper that detailed the process and results, with the authors suggesting its success could be repeated elsewhere. Its open access and usability by multiple entities reduces the repetitious need for identity checks, the authors found.\n\nThe UN is exploring spreading similar technology throughout its own system and sharing it elsewhere as a \"digital public good,\" seeking to expand the Digital Certificate of Entitlement approach to other international organizations.\n\n\"The project has provided not only a technical prototype but also an operational model for how organizations across the UN family can collaborate to design secure, scalable, and inclusive digital public infrastructure,\" wrote Sameer Chauhan, the director of the United Nations International Computing Centre, in a conclusion included in the paper.\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "MGX, a fund backed by Abu Dhabi's royal family, will take a 15% stake in TikTok’s U.S. business as part of a restructuring meant to increase American control of the popular video app, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n\nThe investment, led by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, brings MGX into a partnership with Oracle, the database giant co-founded by Larry Ellison. Together, the two will hold roughly 45% of TikTok’s U.S. entity. With other U.S. investors involved, American companies are expected to own more than 65% of the business.\n\nTikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, will remain a significant shareholder, keeping a 19.9% stake in the U.S. arm, according to the Guardian. That arrangement appears designed to ease concerns in Washington, where President Trump has repeatedly pressed for tighter scrutiny of the app’s ownership and data practices.\n\nMGX’s role in the deal adds another layer of intrigue. Earlier this year, the fund bought $2 billion worth of USD1, a stablecoin launched by Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial. The token is backed by U.S. Treasuries, cash and equivalents, and is pitched as a way for people to access financial services without banks. MGX has already deployed USD1 in its investment in crypto exchange Binance, signaling its willingness to use the stablecoin in large-scale deals.\n\nFor MGX, the TikTok stake provides a high-profile foothold in the U.S. social media market, where the platform’s influence over culture and advertising continues to expand.\n\nCorrection (Sep 29, 16:55 UTC): An earlier version of this story identified Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan as Dubai royal family instead of Abu Dhabi.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Crypto markets modestly bounced on Friday with bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,303.34\nback above $110,000. Ethereum's ether\nETH\n$4,456.73\noutperformed with a 3.8% gain to cross $4,000, while\nDOGE\n$0.2543\nrose 3.4% and Solana\nSOL\n$221.55\nadded 2.5%.\n\nThe cautious bid came as fresh inflation data landed squarely in line with forecasts. The Fed’s preferred measure of prices, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, rose 2.7% year-over-year in August, while core PCE excluding food and energy climbed 2.9%.\n\nThe data report reinforced the Fed’s narrative of gradually easing price pressures, said Fabian Dori, CIO at Sygnum Bank, but it also leaves policymakers balancing sticky inflation with a softer labor market backdrop.\n\n\"For investors, the implications are twofold: if inflation trends lower, risk assets may find support from confidence in the Fed’s easing cycle,\" he said. \"But any upside surprises in coming data could push back short-term rate cut expectations, weighing on equities and boosting the U.S. dollar.\"\n\nMeanwhile, sentiment in crypto remained fragile. The Fear & Greed Index, a well-followed sentiment indicator, plummeted to 28 on Friday, its most depressed level since mid-April signaling \"fear\" among traders. That reflected recent volatility after Thursday's $1.1 billion liquidation wave wiped out leveraged long positions.\n\n\"In recent days, roughly $3 billion of levered longs have been liquidated,\" noted Matt Mena, strategist at digital asset manager 21Shares. With excess leverage largely flushed out, he said positioning has swung to an extreme bearish, Mena noted: popular tokens such as BTC, SOL, and DOGE now show a long-to-short ratio of just one-to-nine.\n\nThat, combined with the Fear & Greed Index at near extremes lows, \"sets the stage for a potential short squeeze,\" Mena argued.\n\nPaul Howard, senior director at trading firm Wincent, didn't share to positive outlook and warned that the market could drift lower before stabilizing. He pointed to BTC dipping below its 100-day moving average under $110,000 and the total crypto market cap sliding under $4 trillion as signs of weakness.\n\n\"The market is in a healthy correction without panic or significant uptick in volatility,\" he said. \"It is likely that we grind lower the coming weeks,” adding he is beginning to question whether crypto revisits record highs in 2025.\n\nRead more: Trump Tariffs, GDP Rattle Markets, ETFs Bleed: Crypto Daybook Americas\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "As Gold Keeps Setting New Highs, China Reportedly Wants to Be Its Custodian for Central Banks",
    "content": "China is reportedly making a bid to expand its influence in global gold markets by offering to hold foreign central bank reserves within its borders.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the People’s Bank of China has used the Shanghai Gold Exchange in recent months to pitch central banks in friendly countries on the idea. At least one Southeast Asian country has shown interest, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe push would allow Beijing to strengthen its role as a bullion hub and reduce reliance on Western financial centers. Custodian services are a key part of that infrastructure, helping to attract more trading activity and enhance credibility.\n\nGold analyst Jan Nieuwenhuijs noted on X that foreign central banks have technically been able to store gold in Shanghai since 2014, but uptake has been minimal so far. He added that one Southeast Asian country, possibly tied to the mBridge cross-border payments project, could be evaluating the option.\n\nThe timing comes as central bank demand has underpinned a powerful rally in bullion.\n\nSpot gold climbed as high as $3,784.74 an ounce in New York on Monday, setting another record before easing slightly. According to MarketWatch, the metal closed last week at $3,789.80, up 43.59% year-to-date — well ahead of bitcoin’s 17% gain, the S&P 500’s 12.96% rise and the Nasdaq Composite’s 16.43% increase.\n\nKitco News reported that despite overbought conditions, analysts expect gold’s bullish momentum to continue, citing inflation trends and growing demand for alternatives to U.S. Treasurys. Chris Mancini, co-portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said investors are increasingly turning to gold as a substitute for the dollar.\n\nStill, China faces competition from established markets such as London, whose vaults hold more than 5,000 tons of global reserves. The World Gold Council ranks China fifth among central bank gold holders, but its domestic market for jewelry, bars and coins remains the world’s largest.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Corporate clients, mainly small and medium enterprises, account for between 10% and 15% of all assets under custody on Mercado Bitcoin, Brazil’s largest crypto exchange, according to Daniel Cunha, the firm’s head of corporate development.\n\n“These companies barely move more than 10% of their holdings at any given time,” Cunha told CoinDesk in an interview at the exchange’s DAC 2025 conference. “They’re here to hold, not trade.”\n\nThe firms are primarily using bitcoin to protect their cash reserves from global volatility, he said, citing growing concern over inflation, currency devaluation and geopolitical instability.\n\nThe trend grew when companies like Strategy (MSTR) started adopting bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Strategy now holds 639,835 BTC, making it the world’s largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Publicly-traded companies, as a whole, hold over 1 million BTC, but how much small and medium enterprises hold isn’t known.\n\nCunha did not reveal the exact figures these companies were holding on Mercado Bitcoin. Brazil has a history of cryptocurrency adoption, ranking fifth in Chainalysis’ Global Crypto Adoption Index, yet it only has one publicly-traded company holding BTC, Méliuz. OranjeBTC is set to soon list on Brazil’s B3 exchange to become the country’s largest publicly traded corporate holder of the cryptocurrency with $400 million in its treasury.\n\nCunha said these companies aren’t chasing yield or experimenting with altcoins, but rather are focusing on BTC and stablecoins like USDT and USDC to manage their treasuries. These holdings serve conservative, cash-management purposes rather than speculative plays.\n\nThe rise in institutional activity is also having a side effect: it’s reducing the overall volatility of crypto markets, Cunha said. That’s making bitcoin a more appealing option for treasurers, even asthe enterprise segment in Brazil is still just starting to adopt crypto.\n\n“The big guys in Faria Lima? They’re on the sidelines,” he said, referring to the financial district in Brazil’s largest city São Paulo often compared to Wall Street. “They haven’t moved yet. It’s all waiting to happen.”\n\nMore For You\n\nAvalanche, CruTrade Tokenize $60M of Collectable Bottles of Fine Wine\n\nThe Avalanche-powered marketplace launches with 200,000 bottles tokenized to cut costs and prevent spoilage in the $9B fine wine market\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Tech-focused investment companies SoftBank and Ark Invest are among the firms in early stage talks to invest in Tether, issuer of the world's largest stablecoin USDT\nUSDT\n$1.0002\n, Bloomberg reported on Friday.\n\nThe report follows this week's news about Tether looking to raise up to $20 billion in a fundraising round that would value the firm at around $500 billion, which would make it one of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nThe fundraising and the hefty valuation underscores the red-hot stablecoin trend, a fast-growing crypto sector with a potential to disrupt global payment flows. Stablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies with prices tied to fiat money like the U.S. dollar, and could offer a cheaper, faster alternative for cross-border transactions using blockchain rails, proponents say. The sector has grown 40% year-to-date to $287 billion, RWA.xyz data shows, and analysts at global bank Citi project stablecoins will hit $4 trillion in market value in its bull market scenario.\n\nTether's USDT is the market leader with a $173 billion market capitalization, predominantly backed by U.S. Treasuries that has provided a windfall of profits from bond yields over the past years. The company reported $4.9 billion in profits in the second quarter of this year.\n\nCircle (CRCL), issuer of the second-largest stablecoin USDC of over $70 billion, went public this June and saw its stock price skyrocket to $300 from around $30, underscoring the investor appetite to gain exposure to the stablecoin theme.\n\nTether, which has focused on serving emerging markets with limited U.S. dollar access, announced earlier this month it intended to formally enter the U.S. market with a dollar token dubbed USAT, designed to meet the requirements of the GENIUS Act, the nation's first federal crypto law which sett rules for stablecoins.

    "title": "State of Crypto: Shutdown Watch",
    "content": "Some of crypto's momentum in Washington D.C. has stalled, a situation that may become worse if the U.S. government shuts down next week.\n\nYou’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.\n\nThe U.S. government seems headed toward a shutdown. While that won't directly affect crypto, the reverberations from the government shutting down will affect policymaking in the crypto world.\n\nThere are three major questions right now when it comes to market structure legislation: Will Congress pass a bill; when might Congress pass a bill; and how will a government shutdown affect this process?\n\nBeyond just Congress, a shutdown might affect regulators' rulemaking efforts, though that may not be as big an issue at the moment (depending, of course, on how long the shutdown lasts).\n\nCongress has until Sept. 30, 2025 — in other words, Tuesday — to pass a budget bill, or at least a continuing resolution that would keep funding the government. Republicans control the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, but they still need some Democrat support to move a budget bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies seemed set to meet and negotiate with President Donald Trump, but Trump canceled the meeting earlier this week. And on Friday, Punchbowl News reported that the House of Representatives' leadership might not bring the body back into session at all until the Senate passes a bill.\n\nA shutdown will likely slow down progress on crypto market structure legislation. The chances of market structure making it through Congress and to the president's desk this year are already growing slim even without the looming shutdown threat, according to multiple people I spoke to this week. A planned markup hearing for the Senate Banking Committee's draft bill was pushed from its tentative Sept. 30 date to late October, and the Senate Agriculture Committee has yet to publish any draft legislation. Any bill addressing market structure would need support from both committees before it moved to the overall Senate and then the House of Representatives.\n\nThe individuals said they still expected to see progress next year, if Congress isn't able to move the market structure bill through the Senate and House before Dec. 31.\n\nThese chances, however, grow more slim in the face of a shutdown. Locking up the federal government is often remedied with quick, short-term spending deals that only push the drama a few weeks or months further down the road and promise future congressional tie-ups.\n\nIf the government does shut down, the Senate committees may have to push back plans for a markup, said Blockchain Association Senior Director of Government Relations Jessica Martinez.\n\n\"While there has been good faith negotiation on both sides, a shutdown would stall critical progress on crypto policy,\" she said in a statement. \"Despite a possible delay, our leaders in Congress are committed to getting bipartisan market structure legislation across the finish line.\"\n\nKristin Smith, the president of the Solana Policy Institute, said she was optimistic that the legislation would continue to receive bipartisan attention, saying that a shutdown would be a \"setback, but it's clear [lawmakers] remain committed\" to passing a market structure bill.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), speaking at CoinDesk's Policy and Regulation event earlier this month, has already tried to tamp down expectations that Congress had to act by the end of September, a deadline previously set by Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott.\n\n\"I don't want to put an artificial deadline on anything, because we're in the middle of negotiations about whether we're going to have a bipartisan budget,\" she said. \"The most important issue that Congress has to deal with right now is the fiscal cliff on September 30. That is a much more important deadline that the entire country is relying on … I really urge you, please don't give market structure an artificial deadline, because it is so important for this industry that we get this right and that we do it on a bipartisan basis.\"\n\nThe bright spot for the crypto industry may come from the regulators. While the federal regulators — the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Treasury Department entities — will all have to stop anything non-critical, a lot of the ongoing rulemaking efforts have already been set in motion. Some of these efforts are in the public comment phase.\n\nDidier Lavallee, the CEO of Canadian firm Tetra Digital, said in a statement that a shutdown might affect SEC Chair Paul Atkins' agenda \"in the medium term,\" but the momentum around crypto policymaking still enjoys bipartisan support.\n\n\"So while there may be short-term delays in policy timelines, it’s unlikely to fundamentally derail progress in the long run,\" he said.\n\nMonday\n\nTuesday\n\nIf you’ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you’d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Bluesky @nikhileshde.bsky.social.\n\nYou can also join the group conversation on Telegram.\n\nSee ya’ll next week!\n\nMore For You\n\nState of Crypto: What Happens to Crypto if Government Shutdown Lingers\n\nA short-term shutdown probably won't hurt crypto's efforts in D.C. much.

    "content": "Strive Asset Management (ASST) has acquired Semler Scientific (SMLR) in an all-stock deal. While historic, the move also drew attention to what may be a problem for investors valuing bitcoin treasury firms.\n\nThe acquisition was the first-ever merger between two Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) holding bitcoin, giving the combined company control of more than 10,900 BTC and increases net asset value (NAV) per share, which DAT investors view as a measure of “yield.”\n\nIn a note this week commenting on the acquisition, Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG, argued that the commonly used “mNAV” metric, defined as market cap divided by crypto held, should be removed from industry reporting altogether.\n\n“At best, it’s misleading; at worst, it’s disingenuous,” the firm claimed in the note.\n\nNYDIG pointed out that it fails to account for operating businesses or other assets that a DAT may own. Most major bitcoin treasury firms do, indeed, operate businesses that add value.\n\nSecond, NYDIG wrote, mNAV often uses “assumed shares outstanding,” which could include convertible debt that hasn’t met conversion conditions.\n\n“Convert holders would demand cash, not shares, in exchange for their debt. This is a much more onerous liability for a DAT than simply issuing shares,” the firm added. “Because convertible debt is essentially volatility harvesting (converts are debt + call options), the DAT is incentivized to maximize its equity volatility.”\n\nCurrently, publicly traded bitcoin treasury firms hold over 1 million BTC, and many are now trading below their mNAV, which could suggest more acquisitions are coming in the near future.\n\nMore For You\n\nAvalanche, CruTrade Tokenize $60M of Collectable Bottles of Fine Wine\n\nThe Avalanche-powered marketplace launches with 200,000 bottles tokenized to cut costs and prevent spoilage in the $9B fine wine market\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin Trails Equities, Metals, and USD in Q3. Here Is a Key Level to Watch for Next Move",
    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,307.43\njust ended what is historically the largest cryptocurrency's third-worst week of the year with a greater-than-average drop of 5%. Week 38 effectively closes out the third quarter, which is up about 1%, as well as September, which has managed to hold flat.\n\nWhile the figures are consistent with the period's historical reputation as one of the weakest seasons of the year, a few catalysts might have contributed to the underperformance.\n\nOn Friday, more than $17 billion in options expired, with the max pain price — the strike price at which option holders lose the most money and options writers profit the most — sitting at $110,000, which acted as a gravitational center for the spot price.\n\nA key technical factor remains the short-term holder cost basis at $110,775, which reflects the average on-chain acquisition price for coins that moved in the past six months.\n\nBitcoin tested this level in August, and in bull markets, it typically moves toward this line multiple times. This year, it broke significantly below that level only once: during the tariff tantrum in April, when it dropped to as low as $74,500.\n\nZooming out, it is important to assess whether bitcoin remains in an uptrend characterized by higher highs and higher lows to get an idea of whether the rally is sustainable.\n\nAnalyst Caleb Franzen highlights that bitcoin has slipped below its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), with the 200-day EMA sitting at $106,186. The previous significant low was around $107,252 on Sept. 1, and for the broader trend to remain intact, bitcoin will need to hold above that level.,\n\nThe U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.8% in the second quarter, well above the 3.3% estimate and the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2023. Initial jobless claims dropped by 14,000 to 218,000, coming in below expectations and marking the lowest level since mid-July. While spending data came in line with the market's expectation. The US core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying inflation that excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% in August 2025 from the prior month.\n\nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries bounced off the 4% support, and is now trading near 4.2%. The dollar index (DXY) continues to hover around long-term support at 98. Meanwhile, metals are leading the action, with silver at around $45 approaching an all-time high at levels last seen in 1980 and 2011. U.S. equities, in the meantime, are just shy of their records.\n\nBitcoin remains the outlier at more than 10% below its peak.\n\nBitcoin treasury companies continue to face severe multiple-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) compression. Strategy (MSTR) is barely positive year-to-date. At one point, it dipped below $300, a negative return for 2025.\n\nThe ratio between Strategy and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) stands at 4.8, the lowest since October 2024, which shows just how much the largest bitcoin treasury company has underperformed bitcoin over the past 12 months.\n\nStrategy’s enterprise mNAV is currently 1.44 (as of Friday). Enterprise value here accounts for all basic shares outstanding, total notional debt and total notional value of perpetual preferred stock minus the company’s cash balance.\n\nThe silver lining for MSTR is that three of the four perpetual preferred stocks, STRK, STRC and STRF, are all sporting positive lifetime returns as Executive Chairman Michael Saylor looks to buy more BTC through these vehicles.\n\nA growing issue for MSTR is the lack of volatility in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's Implied volatility — a measure of the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations — has dropped below 40, the lowest in years.\n\nThis matters because Saylor has often framed MSTR as a volatility play on bitcoin. For comparison, MSTR’s implied volatility is at 68. Its annualized standard deviation of daily log returns over the past year was 89%, while over the last 30 days it has fallen to 49%.\n\nFor equities, higher volatility often attracts speculators, generates trading opportunities and draws investor attention, so the decline is likely acting as a headwind.\n\nMeantime, the fifth-largest bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet (3350), holds 25,555 BTC and still has roughly $500 million left to deploy from its international offering. Despite this, its share price continues to struggle at 517 yen ($3.45), more than 70% below its all-time high.\n\nMetaplanet’s mNAV has dropped to 1.12, down sharply from 8.44 in June. Its market capitalization now stands at $3.94 billion compared to a bitcoin NAV of $2.9 billion, with an average BTC acquisition cost of $106,065.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "A \"Baby Shark\" token hyped last week as officially representing the most viewed video on YouTube, slumped 90% after the issuing platform said the company minting the memecoin belatedly realized it didn't have the authority to do so.\n\nThe token tumbled to under 0.064 cents from Tuesday’s 35 cents high on Story Protocol, a layer-1 blockchain specializing in intellectual property, after the brand owner, Seoul-based Pinkfong Co., issued a formal notice on X on Friday saying the token had “no affiliation whatsoever” with the company.\n\nBaby Shark, a two-minute long music cartoon aimed at young children has garnered more than 16 billion individual views since its 2016 launch. The token, which had a peak market cap of $200 million, was issued using IP.World, which said it relied on faulty rights provided by a Pinkfong licensee and said its verification process blocked creator fees from being released.\n\n“We, and the community, had every reason to believe the launch was fully authorized,” IP.World said.\n\nIn its post, Pingfong said only two assets, a Baby Shark Meme on Solana and Baby Shark Universe Token on BNB Chain, are officially endorsed.\n\nThe statement did little to calm traders who had piled in under the impression of the token was an official Pinkfong collaboration, amplified by influencer endorsements and Story Protocol’s own promotional push.\n\nSeparately, blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps reported that at least one entity funneled funds through multiple fresh wallets to snipe $10 million worth of supply in the first minute of trading — representing roughly 7% of the token’s supply on its Sept. 23rd issuance.\n\nWhile IP.World named the licensee, CoinDesk is not doing so as it has been unable to contact the company concerned for comment.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nTom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Newest Target of Short-Seller Kerrisdale Capital\n\nThe company's model mimics a failing playbook and lacks transparency and leadership appeal, said Kerrisdale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nIt's not been a happy 24 hours for crypto bulls, with the CoinDesk 20 Index dropping 5% and market leaders bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,456.29\nand ether\nETH\n$4,462.40\nfalling nearly 2%.\n\nMajor altcoins such as XRP, BNB and SOL lost even more, and ASTR, the native token of Aster DEX, which recently flipped Hyperliquid in 24-hour volume, fell 4% as the decentralized exchange saw abnormal price movements in the XPL-USDT perpetual trading pair. Still, a few coins, including MNT, CRO, KAS, OKB and XMR, managed gains of around 1%.\n\nThe downturn coincides with a stronger dollar, pushed higher by Thursday’s U.S. GDP and jobless claims data. Meanwhile, market flow dynamics turned bearish.\n\n“ETF behavior changed from a primary absorber of supply to a net seller this week,\" analysts at BRN told CoinDesk. \"Yesterday, Bitcoin ETFs posted $258 million of outflows while Ethereum ETFs recorded $251 million of outflows, marking four straight days of red for ETH funds.”\n\nWhales have also become net sellers, offloading 147,000 BTC since Aug. 21, the most since the bull cycle began in early 2023, according to CryptoQuant.\n\nAnalysts at Bitunix exchange warned that President Donald Trump's tariff announcements on Thursday have increased market uncertainty, with sentiment oscillating between “rising inflation” and “slowing growth.”\n\nTrump announced tariffs of as much as 100% on trucks, furniture and pharmaceuticals, effective Oct. 1.\n\nThe Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditure, is due later today. The report is projected to show a 2.9% year-over-year rise in August, matching July. Month-on-month, it’s forecast to have increased 0.2%, slightly below July’s 0.3%, according to FactSet. A softer-than-expected print could temper the dollar’s rally, putting a floor under bitcoin and the wider crypto market.\n\nTraders should remain vigilant about regulatory developments related to digital asset treasuries. A WSJ report on Thursday cited U.S. regulators' concerns about unusual trading volumes and stock price volatility in over 200 companies linked to crypto treasury strategies. Regulatory pressure on these treasuries, or DATs, could accelerate market sell-offs.\n\nAdditionally, geopolitical developments warrant attention, as reports are circulating about Russia's aerial incursions in Europe.

    "title": "Elliptic Warns of Industrial-Scale Pig Butchering Scams Laundering Through Crypto",
    "content": "Pig butchering, a form of romance fraud in which victims are groomed into sending money to fake crypto investment schemes, has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic’s 2025 Typologies Report.\n\nThe study points to increasingly organized methods of laundering stolen funds using practices that resemble professional financial operations.\n\nElliptic’s investigators found that scammers often pool victims' deposits into self-hosted wallets used only to consolidate and move funds. From there, the money flows through chains of transactions designed to obscure its origin, sometimes passing through cross-chain bridges or payment processing services that offer a veneer of legitimacy.\n\nA common tactic involves using mule accounts at regulated crypto platforms. These accounts frequently share suspicious markers such as identical residential addresses, repeated IP logins, and patterns of transfers between accounts.\n\nPhotos submitted for compliance checks sometimes show operators working out of call centers or warehouses in Southeast Asian countries where pig-butchering operations are known to originate.\n\nThe report underscores that, unlike cash-based crime, blockchain leaves behind visible transaction trails. This transparency gives regulators and platforms new tools to spot suspicious activity even as scammers refine their methods.\n\nElliptic also warns that pig butchering is only one piece of a broader picture. The report also detailed how individuals facing official sanctions are increasingly turning to stablecoins for cross-border transactions.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

KuCoin's alleged violations were said to have been serious and, in the case of the failure to report suspicious transactions, \"severe.\"\n\nKuCoin has been penalized in various jurisdictions in similar cases, including one from the Ontario Securities Commission in 2023.

    "content": "Crypto trading firm Keyrock says onchain asset management is having a breakout year.\n\nIn a new report, the firm estimated that assets under management (AUM) have surged 118% in 2025 to $35 billion, driven by growth across automated yield vaults, discretionary strategies, structured products and credit.\n\nKeyrock predicts that the sector could nearly double again by 2026, reaching $64 billion under a base case scenario, or as much as $85 billion if this year’s growth momentum continues.\n\nDiscretionary strategies were the standout in 2025, up 738% year-to-date, as onchain investing evolves into a credible alternative to traditional finance, the report said.\n\nKeyrock’s report highlighted that three protocols, Morpho, Pendle and Maple, now control 31% of the industry’s AUM, underscoring both scaling leadership and protocol concentration risk.\n\nYield vaults remain the main entry point for allocators, commanding $18 billion in deposits.\n\nWhile smaller wallets dominate in number, whales and dolphins provide the overwhelming majority of liquidity, the report noted, contributing 70%–99% of capital across strategies.\n\nPerformance has matured, with net returns competitive with traditional markets but no longer uniformly higher, the firm said. Automated yield vaults outperformed their TradFi peers by roughly 186 basis points after fees, while structured products and onchain credit lagged slightly once costs were factored in.\n\nDiscretionary strategies delivered hedge fund-like results with the added benefits of liquidity and transparency, the report added.\n\nThe Brussels-based firm recently expanded into asset and wealth management with the acquisition of Turing Capital, a Luxembourg-registered fund manager.\n\nRead more: Crypto Trading Firm Keyrock Buys Luxembourg's Turing Capital in Asset Management Push\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It's now has lost 22% since its record highs last month. Solana\nSOL\n$222.27\n, changing hands above $250 only two weeks ago, plunged below $200, down another 8% today. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 6%.\n\nThe sharp move lower across the board triggered a widespread leverage flush on derivatives markets, liquidating over $1.1 billion worth of leveraged trading positions, CoinGlass data shows. Ether led liquidations with over $400 million long positions, or bets on higher prices, being wiped out, followed by bitcoin's $265 million.\n\nCrypto equities also took a hit. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate owner of BTC, sunk as much as 10% during the session to five-month low. The stock, which is often seen as a leveraged bet on bitcoin's price, gave up all of this year's gains and is now 1.5% down year-to-date, while BTC is still holding on 16% advance during the same period.\n\nEther treasury firms Bitmine (BMNR) and Sharplink Gaming (SBET) were down 7%-8%,as were bitcoin miners MARA Holdings. (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT).\n\nWith Thursday's nosedive, BTC is now on the brink of taking out the lows of late August-early September, when it bottomed just above $107,000.

    "title": "Curve Finance Founder Michael Egorov Launches Bitcoin Yield Protocol",
    "content": "Michael Egorov, founder of Curve Finance, has launched Yield Basis, a decentralized protocol built to provide sustainable bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,358.36\nyield while eliminating impermanent loss (IL), one of decentralized finance’s longest-running challenges.\n\nBitcoin holders have long faced limited opportunities for on-chain returns. Lending markets rarely offer more than a fraction of a percent, while automated market maker (AMM) pools have exposed users to IL — the risk of losing value when token prices diverge. Even in favorable conditions, yields rarely topped 1–2%.\n\nYield Basis tackles this by reengineering the AMM model. The protocol removes IL risk altogether, which Egorov says will enable deeper Bitcoin liquidity on-chain and more attractive yield opportunities for institutional and professional investors. To manage early growth, three pools launched with a $1 million deposit cap each.\n\nThe system borrows from Curve’s five years of infrastructure resilience, adopting a vote-escrow mechanism (veYB) for governance. Token holders must lock their YB to participate in governance and earn protocol fees, distributed in either Curve’s crvUSD stablecoin or wrapped Bitcoin. Unlike many DeFi projects, token emissions aren’t simply handed to liquidity providers; they are tied to position yield, a model Egorov calls “value-protecting.”\n\nYield Basis secured $5 million in early 2025 funding and is the first project to debut on the joint Legion and Kraken launchpad, where the community can access its token sale. While Bitcoin is the initial focus, Egorov says the protocol’s impermanent loss solution could extend to Ethereum, tokenized commodities or even stocks — potentially broadening the scope of yield-bearing assets on-chain.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Key Indicators to Watch in Q4: Bitcoin Seasonal Trends, XRP/BTC, Dollar Index, Nvidia, and More",
    "content": "This is an analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nAs we approach the final quarter of 2025, the following key charts provide valuable insights to help crypto traders navigate the evolving market landscape.\n\nSeasonal trends suggest a bullish Q4 outlook for both bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,456.29\nand ether\nETH\n$4,462.40\n, the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nSince 2013, Bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,349.68\nhas delivered an average return of 85% in the final quarter, according to data from Coinglass, making Q4 historically the strongest period for bulls.\n\nNovember stands out as the most bullish month, with an average gain of 46%, followed by October, which typically sees a 21% increase.\n\nEther\nETH\n$4,459.48\nalso tends to perform well in the last three months of the year, although its strongest historical returns have been in the first quarter since inception.\n\nBitcoin's price has dropped by 5% this week, consistent with the bearish technical signals and looks set to extend losses to late August lows near $107,300. If bulls fail to defend that, the focus will shift to the 200-day simple moving average at $104,200.\n\nThe ongoing price decline, combined with bitcoin's historical pattern of peaking approximately 16 to 18 months after a halving event, may scare bulls.\n\nHowever, such concerns may be premature as long as prices remain above the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This moving average has consistently acted as a support level, marking the end of corrective price pullbacks during the current bull run that began in early 2023.\n\nTraders, therefore, should closely watch the 50-week SMA, which is currently positioned around $98,900, as a key level for broader market direction.\n\nXRP, often called the \"U.S. government coin\" by firms like Arca, has surged 32% this year. However, despite this strong rally, the payments-focused cryptocurrency remains confined within a prolonged sideways trading range against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC), showing limited relative strength.\n\nThe XRP/BTC pair has been confined within a narrow trading range since early 2021, resulting in over four years of low-volatility compression.\n\nRecent price action near the upper boundary of this channel suggests that bulls are gradually gaining control. A breakout from such a prolonged consolidation could trigger a powerful rally in XRP relative to BTC, as the accumulated energy from this squeeze is released.\n\nNow, let’s turn to charts that call for caution.\n\nThe leveraged anti-Strategy ETF (SMST), which seeks to deliver daily investment results that are -200%, or minus 2x, the daily percentage change in bitcoin-holder Strategy's (MSTR) share price, is flashing bullish signals.\n\nThe ETF’s price climbed to a five-month high of $35.65, forming what appears to be an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, characterized by a prominent trough (the head) flanked by two smaller, roughly equal troughs (the shoulders).\n\nThis pattern often signals a potential bullish reversal, suggesting the ETF may be gearing up for a significant upward move.\n\nIn other words, it's flashing a bearish signal for both BTC and Strategy, which is the largest publicly listed BTC holder with a coin stash of 639,835 BTC.\n\nLast week, I discussed the dollar's post-Fed rate cut resilience as a potential headwind for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe dollar index has since gained ground, establishing a double bottom at around 96.30. It's a sign that bulls have successfully established the path of least resistance on the higher side.\n\nA continued move beyond 100.26, the high of the interim recovery between the twin bottoms around 96.30, would confirm the so-called double bottom breakout, opening the door for a move to 104.00.\n\nWatch out for the pattern failure below 96.00, as that could lead to increased risk-taking in financial markets.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), the world's largest listed company by market value, and a bellwether for risk assets, continues to flirt with the upper end of the broadening channel identified by June 2024 and November 2024 highs and lows hit in August 2024 and April 2025.\n\nThe rally has stalled at the upper trendline since late July in a sign of bullish exhaustion. Should it decline from here, it could signal the onset of a risk-off period in global markets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nHBAR Breaks Out of Consolidation as ETF Hopes and Investor Interest Rise\n\nHedera’s native token climbed 2% in a steady 24-hour advance, capped by a late-session breakout fueled by renewed volume.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

A 97% long bias further showed how aggressively users were positioned before the flush.\n\nThe wave came as sentiment remains fragile and bitcoin sees volatile price action around the $111,000 mark. Spikes in liquidations are often read as clearing events that pave the way for reversals, but with positioning stretched across majors and high-beta tokens alike, downside risks linger.\n\nMeanwhile, some say projects with strong revenue flows could emerge attractive to traders amid an otherwise risk-off mood.\n\n“While crypto markets are down, capital is still rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, with perpetual decentralized exchanges (Perp DEXs) like Hyperliquid and Aster leading the charge,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research.\n\n“We expect altcoins to slowly grind upward as investors seek projects that can decouple from macro pressures and continue to grow based on their own utility,” Ruck added.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nHBAR Breaks Out of Consolidation as ETF Hopes and Investor Interest Rise\n\nHedera’s native token climbed 2% in a steady 24-hour advance, capped by a late-session breakout fueled by renewed volume.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency adoption in emerging markets poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial resilience, credit ratings giant Moody's Ratings said in a report on Thursday.\n\nThe risks are most acute in areas where crypto's use extends beyond investment into savings and remittances, according to the report. Moody's suggests that higher penetration of stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar weaken monetary transmission when it leads to pricing and settlement increasingly occurring outside a market's domestic currency.\n\nStablecoins are crypto tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset, such as a fiat currency, with the U.S. dollar comfortably the most prevalent.\n\n\"This creates 'cryptoization' pressures analogous to unofficial dollarization, but withgreater opacity and less regulatory visibility,\" Moody's said.\n\nCryptocurrency can also provide new ways of for capital flight, through pseudonymous wallets and offshore exchange, allowing individuals to move wealth abroad discreetly, undermining exchange rate stability, according to the report.\n\nMoody's also highlighted how increased ownership of cryptocurrency has been concentrated in emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa and parts of Latin America. Here, adoption is often driven by inflationary pressure, currency pressured and limited access to banking services. In contrast, adoption in more advanced economies, adoption is driven by institutional integration and regulatory clarity.\n\nCrypto ownership expanded to an estimated 562 million people by 2024, an increase of 33% from 2023, the report said.\n\nRead More: Stablecoin Adoption Set to Surge After GENIUS Act, Hit $4T in Cross-Border Volume: EY Survey\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Stablecoin Market Could Reach $4 Trillion by 2030, Citi Says in Revised Forecast",
    "content": "The stablecoin market is expanding faster than expected, with issuance volumes rising from about $200 billion at the start of 2025 to $280 billion as of Thursday, according to a report by Citi.\n\nThe bank has lifted its 2030 forecast for stablecoin issuance to $1.9 trillion in its base case and $4 trillion in a bull case, up from $1.6 trillion and $3.7 trillion respectively.\n\nIf stablecoins circulate at a velocity comparable to fiat currencies, they could support up to $100 trillion in annual transactions by 2030 under the base scenario and double that in the bull case. Citi argued this growth reflects blockchain’s “ChatGPT moment” as digitally native companies lead adoption in real-world commerce.\n\nYet the report suggests stablecoins may not dominate all on-chain finance. Bank tokens — such as tokenized deposits — could ultimately see higher transaction volumes, driven by corporate demand for regulatory safeguards, real-time settlement and embedded compliance. A small migration of traditional banking rails on-chain, Citi estimated, could push bank token turnover beyond $100 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nThe forecast also underscored the continued role of the U.S. dollar. Most on-chain money remains dollar-denominated, fueling demand for Treasuries, though hubs like Hong Kong and the UAE are emerging as centers of experimentation.\n\nCiti framed the rise of stablecoins not as a battle to replace banks but as part of a broader reimagining of financial infrastructure. Different forms of digital money — stablecoins, bank tokens and CBDCs — are likely to coexist, each finding its niche.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Could Cut Node Costs, Ease Adoption",
    "content": "Ethereum developers are preparing for the network’s second major upgrade this year, known as Fusaka, set to go live at the end of November or beginning of December, pending final testnet results.\n\nFusaka — a blend of the names Fulu and Osaka — consists of two simultaneous upgrades to Ethereum’s consensus and execution layers, respectively.\n\nThe upgrade is focused on making the Ethereum blockchain more scalable and efficient, and should benefit institutions and users as transaction costs on rollup networks should fall further, while operating nodes should become less cumbersome and expensive for newcomers looking to run nodes.\n\nFusaka includes 12 major code changes, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), that together aim to boost data capacity, lower costs and streamline validator operations.\n\nOne of the most significant additions is EIP-7594, or PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling), a system that allows Ethereum validators to verify data availability by sampling small pieces of it instead of downloading everything. That change enables the network to handle far more rollup data (“blobs”) per block, paving the way for cheaper Layer 2 transactions and greater throughput without compromising decentralization.\n\nFusaka could make it easier for newcomers or smaller players to operate on Ethereum, rather than cutting costs for those already running large validator fleets. The upgrade’s efficiency changes mean that entities running only a few validators — or none at all — could find it simpler and less resource-intensive to start or maintain nodes. However, institutions with extensive node operations, like staking pools, won’t see major cost savings.\n\nVanEck, a prominent asset manager, has said Fusaka will be significant for users, arguing that it will lower costs for rollups and make Ethereum more efficient for large players. Because validators won’t have to download every data blob in full (thanks to PeerDAS), bandwidth and storage demands drop, which means institutions running full nodes or node clusters will see lower infrastructure cost.\n\nThe firm also says Fusaka reinforces ETH’s role as a store of value and settlement asset, since transaction fee revenue at the base layer may shrink as more activity shifts to rollups, but ETH becomes more central in securing and validating that activity.\n\nThe other 11 changes in Fusaka are smaller but still important; things like fine-tuning how transaction fees are calculated, setting clearer limits on block size and adding new tools for developers that make Ethereum apps run faster and work better with standard internet security systems. Collectively, they make Ethereum’s base layer more predictable, flexible and compatible with mainstream cryptography standards.\n\nAfter Dencun last year and Pectra earlier this year, Fusaka continues Ethereum’s rapid cadence of upgrades designed to make the network more scalable and enterprise-friendly.\n\nFusaka has already gone through a first test run on October 1, and will see two additional tests on October 14 and 28, before core developers decide to ink in a date for mainnet.\n\nDevelopers say Fusaka is supposed to set the stage for additional changes in 2026, in the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade. That hard fork is set to focus on introducing enshrined proposer-builder separation — a change that would make Ethereum’s block production process more secure and transparent.\n\nRead more: Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Passes Holesky Test, Moves Closer To Mainnet\n\nMore For You\n\nBee Maps Raises $32M to Scale Solana-Powered Decentralized Mapping Network\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features, and boost contributor incentives, Bee said.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Wall Street Wants in on DeFi. Here’s How to Make It Happen",
    "content": "For years, decentralized finance, or “DeFi,” was treated in traditional finance circles as little more than a speculative casino, frivolous and potentially destabilizing. That perception is changing fast. Hedge funds are experimenting with on-chain liquidity pools, major asset managers are piloting blockchain settlement, and digital asset treasury companies (DATs), chasing the wildly successful strategy of Strategy’s Bitcoin balance sheet, are turning to DeFi to generate yield and return value to investors. Wall Street’s interest is no longer hypothetical. Currently, institutional exposure to DeFi is estimated at about $41 billion, but that number is expected to grow: EY estimates that 74% of institutions will engage with DeFi in the next two years.\n\nThis reflects a broader macro trend: traditional financial institutions are starting to view DeFi not as a risky frontier, but as programmable infrastructure that could modernize markets. The appeal is twofold. First is yield: native staking rewards, tokenized Treasuries, and on-chain liquidity strategies that can turn idle capital into productive assets, something only possible due to the unique features of the technology itself. Second are efficiency gains: real-time settlement, provable solvency, and automated compliance built directly into code.\n\nYet enthusiasm alone will not bring DeFi into the financial mainstream. For institutions to participate at scale, and for regulators to get comfortable, the rules of engagement must evolve. The challenge is not to retrofit DeFi into legacy categories, but to recognize its distinctive strengths: programmable yield, compliance enforced in code, and settlement systems that operate in real time.\n\nFor institutional investors, the most direct attraction is yield. In a low-margin environment, the prospect of generating incremental returns matters. A custodian might channel client assets into a programmable contract like a crypto “vault” that delivers staking rewards or on-chain liquidity strategies. An asset manager could design tokenized funds that route stablecoins into vaults of tokenized Treasury bills. A publicly traded company holding digital assets on its balance sheet might deploy those assets into DeFi strategies to earn protocol-level yield, transforming idle reserves into an engine for shareholder value.\n\nBeyond yield, DeFi infrastructure offers operational efficiency. Rules about concentration limits, withdrawal queues, or protocol eligibility can be written directly into code, reducing reliance on manual monitoring and costly reconciliation. Risk disclosures can be generated automatically rather than through quarterly reports. This combination of access to new forms of yield and lower friction in compliance explains why Wall Street is increasingly excited.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the central issue is compliance. In legacy finance, compliance is typically retrospective, built around policies, attestations, and audits. In DeFi, compliance can be engineered directly into financial products.\n\nSmart contracts, the self-executing software that underpins DeFi, can enforce guardrails automatically. A contract might permit participation only by know-your-customer (KYC)-verified accounts. It could halt withdrawals if liquidity falls below a threshold, or trigger alerts when abnormal flows appear. Vaults, for example, can route assets into predefined strategies with such safeguards: whitelisting approved protocols, enforcing exposure caps, or imposing withdrawal throttles. All while being transparent to users and regulators on-chain.\n\nThe result is not the absence of compliance, but transforming it into something verifiable and real-time. Supervisors, auditors, and counterparties can inspect positions and rules in real time rather than relying on after-the-fact disclosures. This is a game-changing shift regulators should welcome, not resist.\n\nCritics argue that DeFi is inherently risky, pointing to episodes of leverage, hacks, and protocol failures. That critique has merit when protocols are experimental or unaudited. But programmable infrastructure can, paradoxically, reduce risk by constraining behavior up front.\n\nConsider a bank offering staking services. Rather than relying on discretionary decisions by managers, it can embed validator selection criteria, exposure limits, and conditional withdrawals into code. Or take an asset manager structuring a tokenized fund: investors can see, in real time, how strategies are deployed, how fees are accrued, and what returns are generated. These features are impossible to replicate in traditional pooled vehicles.\n\nOversight remains essential, but the supervisory task changes. Regulators are no longer confined to reviewing paper compliance after the fact; instead, they can examine code standards and the integrity of protocols directly. Done properly, this shift strengthens systemic resilience while reducing compliance costs.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s 2023 launch of FedNow, its real-time payment system, illustrates what is at stake. For decades, only banks and a handful of chartered entities have been able to connect directly to the Fed’s core settlement infrastructure. Everyone else has had to route through intermediaries. Today, crypto firms are similarly excluded.\n\nThat matters because DeFi cannot achieve institutional scale without a ramp to the U.S. dollar system. Stablecoins and tokenized deposits work best if they can be redeemed directly into dollars in real time. Without access to FedNow or master accounts, nonbank platforms must rely on correspondent banks or offshore structures, arrangements that add costs, slow down settlement, and increase the very risks regulators are most concerned about.\n\nProgrammable infrastructure could make FedNow access safer. A stablecoin issuer or DeFi treasury product connected to FedNow could enforce over-collateralization rules, capital buffers, and AML/KYC restrictions directly in code. Redemptions could be tied to instant FedNow transfers, ensuring every on-chain token is matched 1:1 with reserves. Supervisors could verify solvency continuously, not just through periodic attestations.\n\nA more constructive approach, therefore, would be risk-tiered access. If a platform can demonstrate through auditable contracts that reserves are fully collateralized, anti-money laundering (AML) controls are continuous, and withdrawals automatically throttle during stress, it arguably presents less operational risk than today’s opaque nonbank structures. The Fed’s own 2022 guidelines for account access emphasize transparency, operational integrity, and systemic safety. Properly designed DeFi systems can meet all three.\n\nThese steps would not open the floodgates indiscriminately. Rather, they would establish a pathway for responsible participation, where institutions can engage with DeFi under clear rules and verifiable standards.\n\nOther jurisdictions are not waiting. If U.S. regulators take an exclusionary stance, American companies risk ceding ground to their global peers. That could mean not only a competitive disadvantage for Wall Street, but also a missed opportunity for U.S. regulators to shape emerging international standards.\n\nThe promise of DeFi is not to bypass oversight but to encode it. For institutions, it offers access to new forms of yield, reduced operational costs, and greater transparency. For regulators, it enables real-time supervision and stronger systemic safeguards.\n\nWall Street wants in. The technology is ready. What remains is for policymakers to provide the framework that allows institutions to participate responsibly. If the United States leads, it can ensure DeFi evolves as a tool for stability and growth rather than speculation and fragility. If it lags, others will set the rules, and reap the benefits.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "SharpLink Gaming Set to Tokenize Its Equity on Ethereum With Superstate",
    "content": "SharpLink Gaming (SBET), the Ethereum treasury firm led by Joseph Lubin, unveiled plans on Thursday to tokenize its equity on the Ethereum blockchain as the stock tokenization trend is gaining steam.\n\nThe Minnesota-based firm said it has tapped tokenization specialist Superstate as its digital transfer agent, while its equity token will be natively issued through Superstate’s Opening Bell platform, a system designed to issue SEC-registered shares directly on blockchain rails.\n\nThe move comes as tokenization of financial instruments such as equity is gaining momentum across crypto markets. A slew of tokenized equity offerings debuted in the past few months predominantly for investors outside the U.S., including by Robinhood, Gemini with Dinari, Ondo Finance's Global Markets and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance. However, some products drew concerns such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulation.\n\nSharpLink's tokenized stock will be legally identical to traditional equity, while it can be stored in digital wallets and integrated with on-chain protocols, the press release said.\n\nBeyond issuance, SharpLink and Superstate also plan to explore how such shares could eventually trade on decentralized exchanges and automated market makers (AMMs). That step, if approved, would test how tokenized securities can circulate in markets built around smart contracts while remaining compliant with U.S. securities rules.\n\nSharpLink's initiative follows digital asset investment firm Galaxy's (GLXY) similar effort to tokenize its Class A common shares on Solana\nSOL\n$221.94\nwith Opening Bell.\n\nSBET is lower by 7% in early trading Thursday alongside a steep slide in the price of ETH to below $4,000.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Circle Internet, (CRCL) is examining ways of reversing transactions involving its stablecoin, USDC, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Thursday.\n\nThe issuer of the second-largest stablecoin is \"thinking through ... whether or not there's the possibility of reversibility of transactions,\" the company's president, Heath Tarbert, said in an interview with the newspaper.\n\nStablecoins, tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial (TradFi) asset such as a fiat currency, are an important cog in the cryptocurrency machine, offering users a hedge against the volatility than can hit tokens like bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,353.03\nand ether\nETH\n$4,457.15\n. They're also finding popularity as a method for international payments. The sector has a market cap of about $300 billion, according to data tracked by CoinGecko. USDC alone has a market cap of $74 billion; market leader Tether's USDT has $173 billion.\n\nTarbert said that allowing transactions to be refunded in case of fraud or disputes, similar to what is possible in TradFi, would help push stablecoins into the mainstream.\n\nSuch a development may rub certain crypto purists up the wrong way, because they consider settlement finality to be non-negotiable. Introducing the possibility of reversing transactions could rely on the the arbitration of a central authority, which many believe is antithesis of the decentralization that lies at cryptocurrency's core.\n\n\"At the same time, we want settlement finality,\" Tarbert said. “So there’s an inherent tension there between being able to transfer something immediately, but having it be irrevocable.”\n\nCircle has been at the forefront of growing adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. this year following its successful initial public offering (IPO) in June.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Crypto for Advisors: Kevin O’Leary talks Crypto Strategy",
    "content": "You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.\n\nIn today’s \"Crypto for Advisors\" newsletter, Kevin O’Leary, entrepreneur and investor, shares both his opinion and crypto investment thesis and how they’ve both changed over time.\n\nThen, Leo Mindyuk, CEO of MLTech answers questions about how everyday investors can access these investments in \"Ask an Expert.\"\n\n– Sarah Morton\n\nFrom Garbage to Gold: Why Crypto?\nIn 2019, I made headlines by calling bitcoin “garbage”. Back then, there was no regulation or oversight. It was chaos. Governments were hostile and unsure how to approach crypto. Now, the landscape has changed entirely.\n\nIn the days before regulatory bodies started coming on board, crypto pioneers –cowboys–made tons of money on crypto’s early volatility. Even in this high-risk landscape, the crypto market proved incredibly productive.\n\nToday, the market has grown to use bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,340.17\nand others as stores of value, digital payment systems or stablecoins. However, we’re still early — crypto adoption isn’t anywhere near its potential.\n\nTalking Regulation\n\nIn the post-Wild West landscape, everyone’s looking for the next big event to drive price discovery. It’s obvious that institutional investment has this potential. Almost no major financial institutions, sovereign funds, etc., have adopted crypto. Any of these bodies weighting BTC at 1% would send price discovery to the moon. The roadblock is regulation.\n\nRegulation began with bitcoin ETFs. First available in Canada, then the U.S. and Europe, they’re now Wall Street’s gateway to crypto. Another key regulation was the GENIUS Act in the United States, which guaranteed stablecoins against USD. Collectively, this legislation shows growing institutional faith in crypto.\n\nThe U.S. Senate’s digital asset market structure bill and the U.S. House’s clarity act are two upcoming pieces of regulation to watch; both create crypto regulation frameworks. Many investors anticipate a bullish market if this legislation passes and the regulatory trend continues. Current price levels of BTC are perhaps indicative of this anticipatory mindset: we’re waiting for the floodgates to open.\n\nOwn the Picks and Shovels\n\nWhen considering crypto assets, it’s easy to overlook the infrastructure needed to scale institutional adoption. I’m very vocal about my “picks and shovels” strategy. If you’re in the crypto market, you should own its supporting infrastructure and tap into the returns associated with crypto without caring much about coin price.\n\nSpecifically, I see exchanges and data centers booming in the case of broader, institutional adoption. I’m an investor in Bitzero, a data center company that provides clean energy for BTC mining. My investment there is a power play — it’s the cheapest power I’ve seen. They mine BTC at a low breakeven, allowing me to profit regardless of its volatility.\n\nExchanges are similar. I invested heavily in WonderFi, which became the largest in Canada. I’m also a Robinhood and Coinbase shareholder. Platforms like this are where price discovery occurs, and they earn per transaction.\n\nBuilding Your Crypto Portfolio\n\nBuying into this space today can range from an infrastructure play to a stablecoin. I own the currencies, exchanges and the energy powering them. Collectively, crypto-related investments are about 20% of my portfolio. I recommend building a diverse crypto portfolio, not through token variety but by investing in companies supporting digital assets.\n\nWhere Coins Belong\n\nAt one point I had 27 crypto positions. Now, I’m confident that I only need three: BTC, ether\nETH\n$4,457.96\n, and stablecoins. BTC and ETH are the gold standard, and together they’re around 90% of my coin holdings. I’m weighting each at 2.5% and wrapping ETH around my BTC, because I like a monthly yield.\n\nMany of my other investments, like stocks and bonds, pay dividends or interest — I can see the income. That’s what my wrapping strategy replicates, while still acknowledging BTC as digital gold: the underlying point is long-term price appreciation. ETH, on the other hand, is where a lot of Wall Street’s stablecoins are trading.\n\nTreasuries and Leverage\n\nWe’ve recently seen public companies’ treasuries buy BTC with massive leverage. I stay conservative. Call it boring, but I hardly leverage my coins: at most 30%. To me, it’s not worth the risk of getting burned if BTC drops 50% overnight.\n\nThe Crypto Investor’s Mindset\n\nIf there’s one thing to understand about crypto investing, it’s that volatility is baked in. Your mindset must be to take advantage of the volatility and productivity by owning both the crypto and its infrastructure: believe in the whole crypto space. This way, you’ll avoid predicting token prices and make money regardless.\n\n- Kevin O’Leary, Entrepreneur and Investor\n\nMaking Sense of Crypto Investment Models: What Access Means in Today’s Market\n\nQ: What does “access” really mean in crypto investing—and why is it important?\n\nA: Access refers to how an investor engages with the crypto ecosystem. In traditional markets, access is relatively uniform. Most investors use a brokerage account to buy stocks or ETFs. In crypto, the landscape is far more fragmented and dynamic. You can buy tokens on centralized exchanges, interact with decentralized protocols, invest in structured products, or allocate capital to professionally managed strategies.\n\nEach access model comes with distinct implications around ownership, custody, execution, transparency, and risk. For example, holding tokens in a private wallet means you control your assets. However, it also requires technical know-how. On the other hand, managed accounts or index-like products offer simplicity and professional oversight, but often at the cost of reduced control.\n\nUnderstanding your access model is foundational. It shapes your entire experience and exposure to digital assets.\n\nQ: What strategy types are available besides just buying and holding tokens?\n\nA: Beyond buy-and-hold, digital assets support a range of sophisticated strategies:\n\n• Delta-Neutral: Balances long and short positions (e.g. spot vs. futures) to eliminate directional exposure. Focused on yield generation, these strategies typically experience minimal drawdowns, making them appealing for steady returns.\n\n• Market-Neutral: Keeps net dollar exposure near zero by exploiting mispricings across assets. Methods such as statistical arbitrage, pairs trading, or baskets aim for uncorrelated returns, often with drawdowns of less than 10%.\n\n• Long-Short Quantitative: Uses systematic signals such as momentum, mean reversion, or factor models to take directional bets. Designed for higher return targets, these strategies accept greater volatility and drawdowns in the 10–20% range.\n\n• Smart Beta: Rules-based frameworks that replicate factor exposures such as momentum, value, or volatility. Often implemented through regulated futures, they provide scalable and transparent access to systematic styles commonly found in traditional finance.\n\nTogether, these approaches broaden investor options beyond passive exposure, enabling more precise control over portfolio risk, return, and diversification.\n\nQ: How should someone choose the right approach to enter the crypto market?\n\nA: Begin with your investment objectives: are you seeking long-term growth, diversification, income generation, or capital preservation? From there, assess both your risk tolerance and your preferred level of engagement.\n\nInfrastructure is equally critical, such as custody, liquidity, and transparency, which define the durability of any investment approach. For example, a non-custodial architecture combined with a real-time performance and risk dashboard helps ensure security, transparency, and control.\n\nToday’s digital asset ecosystem encompasses a diverse range of participants, from high-conviction traders to passive investors. The key is not simply whether to engage, but how to engage — aligning your method of access with your objectives, while fully understanding the trade-offs. In this way, investors can participate intelligently, securely, and at scale.\n\n- Leo Mindyuk, CEO & CIO, ML Tech\n\nMore For You\n\nCoinDesk 20 Performance Update: Bitcoin (BTC) Rises 1%, Leading Index Higher\n\nAave (AAVE) was also a top performer, gaining 1% from Tuesday.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The stablecoin-focused Plasma blockchain's native token, XPL, debuted on major exchanges, including Binance and OKX, on Thursday.\n\nThe token drew a price of up to $1.54 in early trading, resulting in a market capitalization of over $2.8 billion. The plasma token has a genesis supply of 10 billion, of which 18% or 1.8 billion is now in circulation.\n\nThe Plasma network also debuted with over $2 billion in stablecoin total value locked and an EVM-compatible design.\n\nXPR serves as the gas token for transactions and smart contract execution, as well as the staking asset that secures the network, and finally, as the reward token for validators.\n\nPlasma allows gasless transfer of stablecoins for end-users. In other words, it allows zero-fee transfers only for simple USDT sends and receives.\n\nHowever, more complex transactions, such as deploying contracts or decentralized applications, require XPL to be paid as gas, or a portion of stablecoins to be converted to XPL as fees, according to Delphi Digital's explainer.\n\nEarly this week, Plasma launched Plasma One, a stablecoin-native neobank with the aim of providing users with permissionless access to spending, earning, and saving digital dollars.\n\nXPL is the native token of the Plasma blockchain, analogous to ETH on Ethereum and SOL on Solana. XPL serves as the gas token for transactions & smart contract execution, the staking asset securing the network, and the reward token for validators.\n\nThe XPL token has a fixed total supply of 10 billion tokens. Of this, 40%—equaling 4 billion tokens—is allocated for ecosystem and growth initiatives. At launch, 8% of the total supply (800 million tokens) will be unlocked from this ecosystem allocation to support initial activities such as liquidity provision and partnerships.\n\nThe remaining 3.2 billion ecosystem tokens will be gradually unlocked monthly over a three-year period to ensure steady liquidity and ongoing development.\n\nFurthermore, 25% of the supply (2.5 billion tokens) is allocated to founders, developers, and employees, who face a one-year cliff preceding vesting, followed by linear vesting over the next two years. Another 25% (2.5 billion tokens) have been allocated to early backers and strategic partners, with the same vesting terms as the team: a one-year cliff followed by two years of linear vesting.\n\nThe token follows an inflationary model, with Validator rewards initially starting at a 5% inflation rate, which will decrease each year until it stabilizes at 3%.\n\nRead more: Peter Thiel-Backed Plasma Unveils 'HotStuff-Inspired Consensus' For High-Frequency Global Stablecoin Transfers\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nHBAR Breaks Out of Consolidation as ETF Hopes and Investor Interest Rise\n\nHedera’s native token climbed 2% in a steady 24-hour advance, capped by a late-session breakout fueled by renewed volume.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "PayPal and decentralized finance platform Spark have teamed up to grow liquidity for\nPYUSD\n$0.9999\nonchain, aiming to scale deposits from $100 million today to $1 billion in the weeks ahead.\n\nPYUSD, issued by Paxos and pegged to the U.S. dollar, was recently onboarded to SparkLend, Spark’s lending marketplace. The integration gives users the ability to supply and borrow PYUSD, with liquidity supported by Spark’s $8 billion stablecoin reserve pool.\n\nThis approach contrasts with traditional liquidity programs that rely on expensive market-maker incentives, instead offering predictable depth at set borrowing costs.\n\n“Predictable access to deep liquidity is what allows stablecoins like PYUSD to scale quickly,” said Sam MacPherson, CEO of Phoenix Labs, a Spark contributor. He framed the initiative as a blueprint for how fintech firms can use DeFi to bootstrap adoption of new stablecoins.\n\nThe partnership comes as stablecoins see renewed momentum, with global supply climbing nearly $30 billion in three months to $263 billion and daily transaction volumes topping $100 billion.\n\nSpark previously deployed $630 million in on-chain Bitcoin-backed loans to Coinbase.\n\n“With total DeFi value approaching $150 billion, platforms like Spark are crucial to advancing PYUSD as a cornerstone for defi with deep liquidity,” said David Weber, Head of PYUSD Ecosystem, PayPal in a press release.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "U.S.-listed cloud company Cloudflare (NET) announced plans to intorduve a U.S. dollar stablecoin for what it calls the \"agentic web,\" where autonomous AI agents perform tasks like booking flights or ordering groceries.\n\nThe company said on Thursday that the token, dubbed NET Dollar, will enable instant and secure transactions for software agents, developers and creators. Cloudflare framed the initiative as a shift away from the ad-driven economics that have defined the internet for decades.\n\n\"The Internet’s next business model will be powered by pay-per-use, fractional payments, and microtransactions—tools that shift incentives toward original, creative content that actually adds value,\" Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, said in a statement.\n\n\"By using our global network, we are going to help modernize the financial rails needed to move money at the speed of the Internet, helping to create a more open and valuable Internet for everyone,\" he added.\n\nThe firm said itis also contributing to standards such as the Agent Payments Protocol and x402, which aim to make sending and receiving payments online simpler.\n\nWith the move, Cloudflare aims to join a roster of fintechs and payments firms that ventured into the red-hot stablecoin trend that's shaking up cross-border payments. These cryptocurrencies, with prices tied to fait money like the U.S. dollar, offer a cheaper, faster alternative to traditional payment rails using blockchains for settlement. For example, Stripe is building its own blockchain, Tempo, for stablecoin transactions and acquired stablecoin infrastructure provider Bridge for $1.1 billion.\n\nIt's potentially a huge market: stablecoin transaction volumes could reach $1 trillion by 2030, driven by institutional adoption, FX settlement and cross-border flows, trading firm Keyrock projected in a report.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It allows the S&P 500, a wide basket of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies that covers roughly 80% of the U.S. equity market, to trade around the clock with transparent holdings.\n\nFalconX, a digital asset brokerage, was an anchor investor in the product, while Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, will handle future expansion to other blockchains. Janus Henderson, a London-based global asset manager with nearly $500 billion in AUM, is serving as sub-investment manager, while Centrifuge's asset management arm Anemoy oversees the fund.\n\nThe initiative fits into a broader trend of bringing traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and equities, often called real-world assets (RWA), onto blockchain rails. Proponents explore tokenization for operational gains, speedier settlements and around-the-clock trading.\n\nCentrifuge, which has built infrastructure for tokenizing private credit and fixed income since 2017, sees SPXA as its entry point into equities, a tokenization trend that has recently taken off.\n\n\"Indices are the best way to bring stocks on-chain,\" Bhaji Illuminati, CEO of Centrifuge, said in a statement. \"They’re simple, collateral-ready and unlock liquidity in ways individual securities can’t.\"\n\nFor S&P Dow Jones Indices, the offering is a stepping stone to \"build the future of index-linked financial products\" traditional finance products are beginning to migrate to blockchain environments, said Cameron Drinkwater, chief product officer at S&P DJI.\n\nRead more: Blockchain-Based RWA Specialists Bring $50M to Apollo's Tokenized Credit Strategy\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Strong resistance formed just above $1,030, while support held firm around $987.\n\nThe price briefly recovered, ticking up from just below $990 to near $994.

    "content": "Bitcoin’s latest breakout is being fueled by institutions and steady on-chain demand rather than speculation, according to new data from Glassnode.\n\nIn the Oct. 8 edition of its \"The Week On-chain\" newsletter, the analytics firm said bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high near $126,000 earlier this week was powered by strong ETF inflows and consistent accumulation from smaller market participants.\n\nThe move pushed bitcoin into fresh price discovery before consolidating near $122,500 on Wednesday.\n\nGlassnode said more than $2.2 billion flowed into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs within a single week, marking one of the strongest waves of institutional buying since April.\n\nThose inflows reversed the mild redemptions seen in September and helped absorb much of the available supply on exchanges.\n\nThe firm noted that the fourth quarter has historically been bitcoin’s most favorable season, as professional investors often rebalance portfolios toward higher-risk assets such as crypto and small-cap stocks.\n\nSustained ETF demand, it added, could continue to anchor prices as year-end approaches.\n\nGlassnode’s on-chain data show that mid-tier holders, or wallets containing between 10 and 1,000 BTC, have been the main buyers behind the latest leg higher.\n\nThese accounts have apparently steadily increased their balances while larger whales have taken moderate profits, creating what the firm described as a “more organic accumulation phase.”\n\nNearly 97% of circulating supply is now in profit, a level that typically marks late-stage bull cycles but does not yet show signs of exhaustion.\n\nThe report highlighted the $117,000–$120,000 zone as a key area of on-chain support, with roughly 190,000 BTC last transacted there — a price range where new buyers may step in if markets pull back.\n\nWhile Glassnode described market conditions as “robust but maturing,” it cautioned that futures open interest and funding rates have both risen sharply. It noted that annualized funding now exceeds 8%, suggesting a buildup of leveraged long positions that could heighten short-term fragility.\n\nEven so, Glassnode argued that realized profits remain controlled compared with prior market tops, signaling that investors are rotating holdings rather than rushing to exit.\n\nOverall, Glassnode said bitcoin’s structure remains sound, underpinned by institutional demand, deep liquidity, and broad-based accumulation.\n\nThe firm concluded that as long as ETF inflows persist, bitcoin’s rally could extend further into the fourth quarter, reinforcing its position as the most structurally supported uptrend in years.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis Trend Has Marked Local Tops in Bitcoin, but This Time May Be Different\n\nDespite increasing by 450,000 BTC since July, short-term holders remain below prior highs, signaling tempered market sentiment.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Forward Industries (FORD) unveiled a validator node on the Solana blockchain, delegating its entire stash of 6.8 million SOL ($1.5 billion) to it.\n\nBuilt on DoubleZero, a global network designed to improve the performance of blockchain systems, the validator allows investors to delegate stake to Forward at zero cost, the company said.\n\nIt uses Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client and is integrated with Galaxy, both of which have supported Forward’s Solana-focused treasury strategy.\n\nBlockchain validators are network participants responsible for verifying and authorizing new transactions and creating new blocks. Their importance lies in their arbitration of trust and security for a decentralized network, collectively enforcing protocol rules and achieving consensus on the accurate state of the ledger.\n\nForward's validator is expected to rank among the top 10 on the Solana network by stake. All 6.8 million tokens held by Forward have been delegated to the node, with future validators also planned to run exclusively on DoubleZero.\n\nIt comes nearly a month after Forward completed a $1.65 billion private investment round to build out what is now the largest solana treasury among publicly traded companies. DeFi Development Corp (DFDV), the second-largest publicly traded SOL treasury firm, holds around 2.09 million tokens.\n\nForward Industries followed that private investment round with a $4 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity program, giving it flexibility to grow its holdings and operations.\n\nForward Industries’ shares dropped 7% on Tuesday, but pared some of these losses in early trading Wednesday to trade over 4% higher at $24.67 during morning trading.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The Australian treasury revealed a new draft proposal for crypto firms in the country, requiring them to hold licenses and be treated as financial products.\n\nThe proposal would require crypto firms to hold financial service licenses, effectively bringing them under the wing of the country's securities regulator, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\n\nDigital asset platforms (DAPs) and tokenized custody platforms (TCPs) will fall under the same bracket as other financial intermediaries, and subject to the same licensing and consumer protection rules.\n\nDaniel Mulino, assistant treasurer, revealed the draft legislation on Thursday. Mulino explained that the plan is to bring crypto under existing financial services rules.\n\n\"The final legislation will introduce a new framework for digital asset businesses in Australia. It will do so by extending existing financial services laws but in a targeted way,\" Mulino said.\n\nKate Cooper, CEO of OKX Australia, said that the draft legislation is a clear indication that crypto is now fully embedded in the country's financial system.\n\n\"The draft legislation is the clearest signal yet that crypto is no longer operating on the fringes and is now embedded in the financial system. The real measure of this reform will be shown by the compliance and enforcement that follows its implementation, ensuring that responsible, licensed operators aren’t undercut by unregulated players and that Australian consumers are protected,” Cooper said.\n\nThe treasury has opened the draft legislation for consultation. The consultation window is open until Oct. 24, 2025.\n\nUPDATE (Sept. 25, 06:15 UTC): Adds comment from OKX Australia CEO on the draft legislation.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried's Sudden 'gm' Lifts FTT Token as FTX Set to Repay $1.6B",
    "content": "\"What\": a simple reply by crypto influencer Gainzy pretty much summed up the sentiment when the notorious convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF, seemingly posted on social media after a long hiatus (and despite being in jail).\n\nTo make matters worse, the token linked to defunct crypto exchange FTX surged nearly 24% in the last 24 hours, after his X account posted a simple \"gm\" on Tuesday.\n\nThis simple post seems to have been taken as an opportunity by speculative crypto traders to pump the FTT token, which now has no value associated with it, nearly 50%-60% within minutes, reaching a peak of around $1.20-$1.23. Despite his incarceration and clarification that the post was made by a \"friend\" on his behalf, the token is still up 25%, trading around $1.014, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nThe FTT token has also seen a sharp increase in activity and trading volumes following the post, according to data compiled by The Tie.\n\nThe number of active addresses reached 201, significantly outpacing the monthly average of 56, The Tie said. Additionally, centralized exchange deposits doubled, reaching 13, while withdrawals quadrupled to 38 compared to the monthly average, it added.\n\nThe crypto community on X reacted swiftly with anger, skepticism and humor to SBF's post.\n\nOne of the most scathing replies came from on-chain investigator ZachXBT. In a now-deleted post, he condemned SBF, stating that he “deserves zero human rights” due to the harm caused by FTX’s collapse. His view reflects a segment of the community’s lingering resentment towards FTX's collapse, which hurt investors who are still waiting for some of their funds from its bankruptcy estate and the broader crypto community.\n\nRead more: Who Won and Lost Most in Sam Bankman-Fried's Criminal Scheme?\n\nOther community members, including Laura Shin, mocked SBF’s sudden social media activity, saying, \"That's so 2021.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder who now runs crypto venture fund Maelstrom, took a humorous jab, replying “Wen memecoin?” — a likely playful reference to the speculative, meme-driven nature of the surge in FTT token after SBF's unexpected post. This potentially underscores a view that the price movement was more about market psychology than substance.\n\nThe surge in FTT token — once a key utility token for trading fee discounts and staking benefits on the FTX exchange — has been largely dormant since the platform’s spectacular implosion that ushered in a brutal crypto winter that devastated many investors.\n\nHowever, strangely enough, this is not the first time this has happened. The same thing unfolded in February of last year, when the SBF's account posted on X for the first time in two years. At the time, he was detained in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, and his lawyers were working through an appeal of his conviction (the appeal is ongoing, with arguments currently scheduled for November 2025).\n\nThe new social media post also came as the FTX estate continues to work to repay creditors.\n\nThe FTX Recovery Trust is set to release $1.6 billion to creditors at the end of this month, marking the third major payout since the crypto exchange's implosion nearly three years ago.\n\nThis recent activity, though potentially short-lived, shows the token still reacts sharply to headlines and sentiments — especially those tied to its controversial founder.\n\nRead more: Private Jets, Political Cash Among $1B in Sam Bankman-Fried's Forfeited Assets: Court\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto bulls can take some comfort in the fact that there is only one week left in September, a historically bearish month, and what's usually the strongest quarter is just around the corner.\n\nSentiment within the industry remains subdued. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index sits at 45, which is neutral, but leaning slightly closer toward fear than greed. Part of the reason is bitcoin’s underperformance compared with traditional assets. In the past three months, bitcoin has added 7%, while the S&P 500 gained 9% and gold 12%.\n\nLooking ahead, $17 billion worth of bitcoin options expire tomorrow, with a max pain price (the level at which option holders would experience the most financial loss) of $110,000. That is slightly below the current spot price of $112,000 and could provide short-term gravitational pull. For now, bitcoin is expected to consolidate between $110,000 and $116,000 until October.\n\nMeanwhile, the most notable action continues to be in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing stocks such as IREN (IREN). Bitcoin treasury companies, however, remain under pressure. KindlyMD (NAKA) is struggling at $1.17, just above its Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) pricing, and Metaplanet (3350) fell another 4% in Tokyo. The stock has dropped more than 70% from its all-time high, leaving it trading at a 1.24 multiple to net asset value (mNAV). This decline highlights how mNAVs have compressed across the broader market.

    "content": "The global population of crypto millionaires has reached 241,700, up 40% in the past year, according to the Crypto Wealth Report 2025 by Henley & Partners.\n\nThe surge coincides with a broader rally that lifted total digital asset market capitalization to $3.3 trillion in June, a 45% increase year-on-year, the report, featuring data from global wealth intelligence firm New World Wealth, said.\n\nBitcoin remains the main driver of wealth creation in the sector.\n\nHolders with portfolios above $1 million in BTC climbed 70% to 145,100 year-over-year. At the upper end, 450 individuals now hold at least $100 million in crypto, while 36 billionaires control even larger stakes.\n\nThe report points to a shift in how digital assets are used, with Bitcoin increasingly treated as collateral rather than a speculative play. This evolution, observers say, is transforming the token into the base layer of a parallel financial system.\n\n\"Bitcoin is becoming the foundation of a parallel financial system, where [it] is not merely an investment for speculation on fiat price appreciation, but the base currency for accumulating wealth.” Philipp A. Baumann, founder of Z22 Technologies, said in the report.\n\nCrypto’s decentralized nature is also redrawing patterns of global wealth. Analysts note that investors are pursuing citizenship and residency programs to navigate regulatory uncertainty while securing access to banking and tax-efficient jurisdictions.\n\nHenley’s annual Crypto Adoption Index ranks Singapore, Hong Kong, the U.S., Switzerland, and the UAE as the top five destinations for digital asset investors.\n\nWith over $14 trillion in wealth moving across borders last year, the report argues that crypto’s portability—secured by little more than a seed phrase—marks a fundamental break from centuries of place-based financial systems.\n\n\"Today, cryptocurrency has made geography optional — with nothing more than 12 memorized words, an individual can secure a billion dollars in Bitcoin, instantly accessible from Zurich or Zhengzhou alike,\" said Dominic Volek, Group Head of Private Clients at Henley & Partners.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Traders are essentially pricing a 77% probability that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management will announce a shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations by Dec. 31. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a shutdown by Oct. 1 stood at 63%.\n\nAccording to media reports, the White House is preparing for large-scale job cuts in the event of a shutdown. On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo asking agencies to prepare plans for staff reductions and furloughs if a spending bill is not passed next week.\n\nThe government is reportedly expected to run out of money by the end of September. To prevent the resulting shutdown, Congress must either approve a short-term funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, or pass 12 full-year funding bills. Since lawmakers won’t finish the full-year bills before the deadline, a temporary funding stopgap is needed.\n\nMore importantly, to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass funding bills, support from both parties is usually necessary.\n\nEther fell over 3% in Asia, almost testing $4,000 for the first time Aug. 8, with bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,167.25\nfalling over 1% to under $112,000.

Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, traded flat to positive.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of the cautious crypto market sentiment was not clear at the time of writing, growing concerns about a potential government shutdown may have contributed to the risk-averse mood among investors.\n\nFurthermore, overnight comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly reiterated her support for further rate cuts, but declined to provide a timeline, instead stressing data dependence, which may have hurt sentiment.\n\nThe Fed cut rates by 25 basis points on Sept. 17 while hinting at two more rate cuts by the year's end. Since then, policymakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have signaled a cautious approach to future rate cuts.\n\nSeven Fed officials, including the New York Fed's Williams, are scheduled to speak on Thursday. Meanwhile, traders are awaiting Friday's PCE data, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.\n\n\"If inflation pressures appear contained, markets may interpret this as room for further Fed cuts, providing liquidity tailwinds into Q4.

    "title": "U.S. Treasury Action to Blame for Bitcoin’s Break From Global M2, Raoul Pal Says",
    "content": "Raoul Pal, founder of Global Macro Investor, has drawn attention to a widely circulated chart that compares bitcoin’s\nBTC\n$122,241.37\nmovements with global M2 money supply.\n\nThe chart shows that since early 2023, bitcoin has tended to track global M2 money supply with a consistent 12-week lag, implying that changes in liquidity conditions filter through to crypto markets with a three-month delay.\n\nBased on that model, bitcoin would still be on track to approach $200,000 by the end of 2025 if the correlation were to hold.\n\nHowever, since July 16, this relationship has broken down. While global M2 has continued to trend higher, reflecting ongoing monetary expansion globally, bitcoin has stalled, moving sideways through the summer despite its historically tight connection to liquidity.\n\nPal argues that the break is not a failure of the model but rather the result of actions by the U.S. Treasury through its Treasury General Account (TGA). The TGA is the government’s operating account at the Federal Reserve, used to receive taxes, bond sale proceeds, and other inflows while also funding federal expenditures.\n\nWhen the Treasury seeks to rebuild this account by issuing more bonds than needed to cover immediate obligations, it effectively drains liquidity from the system, reducing the pool of capital available to risk assets. According to Pal, since July, the Treasury has issued about $500 billion in bonds to replenish the TGA, pushing its balance near $800 billion, a multi-year high.\n\nThis large-scale withdrawal of cash has hit liquidity-sensitive assets like crypto the hardest, explaining bitcoin’s sideways action despite rising M2.\n\nImportantly, Pal believes the TGA is now sufficiently replenished, meaning the liquidity drain is likely over and should fade completely by the end of the month. If that happens, liquidity conditions will normalize, and bitcoin's braoder rally could resume following its M2-driven trajectory upward.\n\nHowever, to counter Pal’s argument, it is worth noting that tech stocks and gold have continued to set new all-time highs, suggesting that broader risk appetite remains intact.\n\nWhile the TGA replenishment may have weighed heavily on crypto, the sharper impact could also reflect heavy selling pressure from long-held coins, which helps explain the deviation between bitcoin and global M2.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin’s On-Chain Profitability Has Surged With 97% of Supply Now in Profit: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode says bitcoin’s breakout to record highs came on the back of $2.2 billion in ETF inflows and steady accumulation from smaller holders, not speculative hype.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin, Stocks Hit by $400B Liquidity Drain From U.S. Treasury Account, Not Jackson Hole: Analysts",
    "content": "Move over Jackson Hole and inflation fears. The real driver behind the recent swoon in crypto and stock markets is likely the impending liquidity drain stemming from the U.S. government’s Treasury General Account (TGA), a checking account held at the Federal Reserve that is poised for a significant buildup.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$122,211.12\nhas declined by over 8% to $113,500 since hitting record highs above $124,000 last Thursday, according to CoinDesk data. Prices for other major tokens such as ether\nETH\n$4,444.58\n,\nXRP\n$2.8679\n, and solana's SOL\nSOL\n$221.04\nhave also corrected, dragging the broader market lower. The CoinDesk 80 Index has dropped 13% since last Thursday.\n\nThe bullish momentum has also weakened on Wall Street, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell by nearly 1.40% to $23,384 on Tuesday, having hit a record high of $23,969 a week ago.\n\nMost market commentary has attributed the losses on Wall Street and in crypto markets to investor de-risking ahead of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell’s scheduled speech at this week’s Jackson Hole event. The prevailing view is that persistent inflation data may prevent Powell from meeting the market’s dovish expectations.\n\nHowever, David Duong argues that the primary driver of the sell-off is the fear of a liquidity drain from the expected TGA refill.\n\n\"Jackson Hole and PPI are just excuses for market players to trim risk ahead of the U.S. Treasury's TGA liquidity drain (~$400B) in the weeks ahead. This explains why bitcoin has lost trend alongside many equity names. But we think the path forward looks clearer in September,\" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, said on X.\n\nThe Treasury General Account is the U.S. government's operating account at the Federal Reserve, which is used to collect taxes, customs duties, proceeds from the sale of securities, and public debt receipts, while facilitating government payments.\n\nJust as our savings bank accounts, the TGA balance fluctuates daily, rising with receipts and falling with payments.\n\nThe Treasury typically spends the cash balance during periods of fiscal uncertainty, such as the evergreen debt ceiling saga, to ensure the government meets its obligations. The so-called TGA spend typically adds to liquidity in the system, greasing risk assets, as seen in early 2023 and early this year.\n\nThe opposite occurs when the Treasury seeks to rebuild its balance by issuing more debt than necessary to fund its obligations. This tends to suck out liquidity from the system.\n\nThe TGA balance has risen from roughly $320 billion to over $500 billion since late July, according to data source MacroMicro. Seeking Alpha estimates that the Treasury may need to issue new debt worth $500-$600 billion in the next two to four months to restore the TGA to healthy levels.\n\nThe rebuild is happening against the backdrop of fragile conditions than in previous years, according to Delphi Digital.\n\n\"Compared to 2023, the financial system now faces fewer liquidity buffers, tighter balance sheet capacity, and a diminished foreign bid for Treasuries. The structural ability to absorb large-scale issuance has weakened across all major channels. If the Federal Reserve maintains its tightening stance or delays a pivot, the resulting mismatch between supply and available demand could drive up funding rates and spill over into broader risk assets, including crypto,\" Marcus Wu, research analyst at Delphi Digital, said in an explainer.\n\nWu added that the last large-scale rebuild, which happened in the second half of 2024, was compensated by other pro-liquidity developments such as the $2 trillion in the Fed's RRP facility, healthy bank reserves and strong foreign demand for the debt.\n\nHowever, these factors have eroded over time, \"leaving the current liquidity environment ripe for disruption,\" Wu noted.\n\nTo cut a long story short, liquidity constraints pose a significant challenge for BTC bulls looking to engineer a steep uptrend well into the year-end.\n\nRead more: Cardano, Dogecoin Lead Crypto Losses as Bitcoin Traders Fear Pullback to $100K\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin’s On-Chain Profitability Has Surged With 97% of Supply Now in Profit: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode says bitcoin’s breakout to record highs came on the back of $2.2 billion in ETF inflows and steady accumulation from smaller holders, not speculative hype.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Gold (XAU) has had a remarkable run this year, standing out among major assets, including bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,250.02\n. But it’s not just gold – its precious counterparts silver, platinum, and palladium have also enjoyed strong gains, outperforming BTC.\n\nWhile gold's price has surged by 44% to a record $3,784, silver has gained 53% to $44.32 per troy ounce, according to data source TradingView. If that's not enough, platinum has gained 60% to $1,452, while palladium has risen 33% to $1,207.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, has failed to keep pace with the precious metals, rising just over 20% to $113,000.\n\nThe verdict is clear when considering the year-to-date performance: precious metals, led by gold, remain the go-to safe havens and inflation hedges amid a deteriorating fiscal outlook for advanced economies, rising threat to the Fed's independence and President Donald Trump's trade war.\n\nMoreover, central banks diversifying into gold have provided a major tailwind for the metal and its precious counterparts. Global central banks cumulatively hold around 36,000 metric tons of gold, according to a European Central Bank study.\n\nTheir buying spree kicked off in the wake of the coronavirus crisis and accelerated further after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, both events injecting inflationary pressures into the global economy. Over the past three years, they’ve added more than 1,000 metric tons annually, a record pace that’s more than twice the average of the previous decade.\n\nBitcoin, however, has yet to earn a place on central banks' balance sheets, limiting its role as a reserve asset. Additionally, the cryptocurrency's gains may have been capped by continued liquidations/distributions by old wallets above $110,000.

    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$122,312.08\nremains stagnant in the $110,000 to $120,000 range, while gold and U.S. equities hover near all-time highs.\n\nAccording to Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score by cohort, selling pressure is evident across all wallet groups. This metric measures the relative strength of accumulation based on the size of entities and the volume of coins acquired over the past 15 days. A value closer to 1 signals accumulation, while a value closer to 0 signals distribution. Exchanges and miners are excluded from this calculation.\n\nCurrently, every cohort, from wallets holding less than 1 BTC to whales holding over 10,000 BTC, is in distribution. The largest whales, with holdings above 10,000 BTC, are showing some of the most aggressive levels of selling over the past year.\n\nLooking at long-term holder supply, the percent of circulating supply unmoved for at least 1 year has dropped sharply from 70% to 60%. The peak was in November 2023, when bitcoin traded near $40,000. At the same time, 2+ year holders also began to sell, with their share declining from 57% to 52%.\n\nThe three year plus cohort now sits just above 43% and has been steadily falling since November 2024. These wallets largely represent buyers from the previous cycle top in November 2021 at around $69,000, many of whom accumulated more during the 2022 bear market when prices hit lows of $15,500. With bitcoin’s recovery, these investors are realizing gains.\n\nBy contrast, five year plus holders remain steady, reflecting that the longest-term investors are not participating in the sell-off.\n\nThis trend shows that investors sitting on unrealized profits from this cycle are continuing to realize profits, adding to the ongoing selling pressure.\n\nRead more: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF: Bearish Sentiment in IBIT Stays Strong for Two Straight Months\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin’s On-Chain Profitability Has Surged With 97% of Supply Now in Profit: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode says bitcoin’s breakout to record highs came on the back of $2.2 billion in ETF inflows and steady accumulation from smaller holders, not speculative hype.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Canton Network, a blockchain built for regulated finance, has struck a strategic partnership with Chainlink to broaden institutional adoption.\n\nThe agreement, announced Wednesday, will see Canton integrate Chainlink’s suite of services, including Data Streams, Proof of Reserve, and its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. Canton has also joined the Chainlink Scale program, which helps cover the costs of running oracle nodes that feed external data into blockchains.\n\nChainlink Labs will take on the role of Super Validator in Canton’s Global Synchronizer, a system designed to keep transactions across the network in sync. That places Chainlink alongside a roster of more than 30 super validators and 500 validators already supporting Canton, which processes $280 billion in daily repo transactions and secures over $6 trillion in tokenized real-world assets.\n\nFor institutions, the deal could mean faster access to tokenized securities, stablecoins, and digital identity tools without sacrificing compliance or privacy. Imagine a bank issuing tokenized bonds on Canton and relying on Chainlink to confirm collateral values in real time—a scenario designed to cut costs while reducing counterparty risk.\n\nChainlink already secures more than $100 billion across decentralized finance and has helped facilitate $25 trillion in transaction value. Its entry into Canton aligns with growing demand from financial firms exploring tokenized assets and cross-chain applications.\n\n“The collaboration brings together Canton’s focus on regulated finance with Chainlink’s infrastructure, paving the way for real-world institutional use cases,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in the release.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Hut 8 (HUT), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Bit Digital (BTBT) were up closer to 6%. From the April lows, IREN has been the standout performer, gaining nearly 500%.\n\nFueling the momentum today is news that OpenAI, Oracle (ORCL), and SoftBank are accelerating their Stargate AI infrastructure program, with five new U.S. data center sites. The expansion will bring nearly 7 gigawatts of planned capacity and over $400 billion in investment, with a goal of reaching 10 gigawatts by the end of 2025, according to Open AI.\n\nThe sheer scale of speculation for AI demand could be entering \"bubble territory\" but AI miners are one of the main beneficiaries of the capital and infrastructure needed to meet those massive energy requirements.\n\nEven traditional pure-play BTC miners like Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK) are now moving into AI and high-performance computing and their stocks have both benefitted, with RIOT up 85% year-to-date and CLSK ahead 55%.

The round included participation from the venture arms of Sony and Samsung, as well as Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division and Hashed.\n\nThe startup is led by Nassim Eddequiouaq, a former Meta and a16z crypto executive who worked on Libra, Meta’s now-defunct stablecoin project. Eddequiouaq said Bastion’s product suite goes beyond simple issuance: it includes wallets for users and off-ramps that allow conversion to cash in over 70 countries.\n\nThe valuation of this latest funding round wasn’t revealed, and the company raised $25 million back in 2023 in a round led by a16z crypto.\n\nThe company said it’s seeing particular traction in Asia, where demand from enterprise customers is rising. The fresh funding will support product expansion and hiring. Bastion has also recently added new leadership across compliance, treasury, legal and revenue, the company said.\n\nThat positions Bastion to compete with firms like Paxos and newer players like Agora. The firm declined to name which corporations are currently using its platform, but Eddequiouaq said announcements are coming within the next nine months.\n\nThe funding comes amid a broader stablecoin boom. Stripe recently acquired stablecoin startup Bridge for $1.1 billion, USDC issuer Circle went public over the summer, while leading stablecoin issuer Tether is reportedly looking to raise up to $20 billion at a valuation that could be as high as $500 billion.\n\nUPDATE (Sept. 24, 13:58 UTC): Updated story to add that Bastion said it's seeing traction in Asia and details the use of funds.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Over the years, the platform has expanded across multiple blockchains, including Stellar, Ethereum, and VeChain.\n\nAccording to Sarah Song, Head of Business Development at BNB Chain, Benji's expansion to BNB Chain stands out because the chain offers a purpose-built environment for tokenization.\n\n\"BNB Chain has a purpose-built environment that issuers can’t find elsewhere: fast settlement, low fees, and compliant data tooling in one ecosystem,” said Sarah Song, head of business development at BNB Chain.\n\n\"For an institution like Franklin Templeton, it’s not only about the technology, it’s about partnering with a chain that already demonstrates real liquidity and adoption at scale,\" Song explained.\n\nAs of the time of writing, the total value of real-world assets tokenized on theBNB chain was over $542 million, making it the eighth-largest in the world, according to BNB's Dune-based tracker. The global RWA market has grown fivefold in three years and is estimated to reach $30 trillion by 2030.\n\n\"Institutional adoption of tokenization is moving from pilot projects to scaled deployment. The early question was whether regulated assets could exist on-chain; today, the focus is on which networks can support them at institutional standards. Franklin Templeton’s expansion to BNB Chain reinforces that tokenization is no longer a theory but an operating reality - and BNB Chain is one of the networks carrying it forward,\" Song told CoinDesk.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Melee, a new prediction market startup that says speculation and betting should be as open as online discussion, has raised $3.5 million from Variant, DBA and a group of angel investors to roll out what it calls “Viral Markets.”\n\nCrypto native companies have witnessed the runaway success of Polymarket, the digital asset betting platform that grew to prominence during the U.S. election campaigns. Other novel projects to emerge include ‘Forecast Markets,’ a type of dated futures contracts launched on Clearmatics’ Autonity blockchain.\n\nMelee, which allows anyone to easily create a market on anything, sees prediction markets evolving alongside the internet like other types of social networks, following dimensions like media type, social graphs, interest graphs, and more, VC firm Variant said in an email.\n\n“We see prediction markets not as a winner-take-all market but as a burgeoning category, much like social networks, where there can be many winners. Social networks reshaped the way we create and consume information and media,” Variant said.\n\n“Unlike existing platforms that rely on centralized teams or professional market makers, Melee uses a pricing mechanism that rewards traders for being early and correct,” Variant added.\n\nThe design also aims to attract creators. Influencers, podcasters or streamers can open markets tied to their audience’s interests and earn revenue from trading activity without taking on reputational risk. A fictional example might be a streamer launching a market on whether a blockbuster video game release will hit its target date, allowing fans to speculate directly alongside the conversation.\n\nFor traders, the appeal lies in asymmetric upside. Entering a market early means lower costs of exposure, and payouts rise as more participants join and the outcome becomes clearer.\n\nThe project’s team includes veterans of Solana, Avalanche, Monad, SIG, Microsoft and Amazon. The long-term vision, according to the announcement, is to create “humanity’s platform for valuing beliefs,” where millions of markets continuously reflect shifting cultural sentiment in real time.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "HBAR Plunges to $0.217 Before Staging Strong Recovery Rally",
    "content": "HBAR traded with sharp volatility over a 23-hour window from September 23 to 24, gaining just 0.90% despite wide intraday swings. The token ranged between $0.217 and $0.225, with the critical 04:00 session on September 24 marking a steep drop to $0.217 before a strong rebound. That zone now acts as support, while $0.225 remains firm resistance.\n\nTrading volumes suggest institutional players stepped in during the selloff. Turnover hit 97.05 million at 04:00, far above the 37.89 million average, signaling accumulation at lower levels. Later, selling pressure returned, with HBAR slipping from $0.224 to $0.223 in the final hour of trading on volume nearly triple the norm.\n\nThe volatility came alongside a major development: Canary Capital’s filing for a spot HBAR ETF with a 1.95% expense ratio. Analysts say the move underscores institutional recognition of Hedera’s hashgraph technology and could support long-term growth, with price targets of $0.50 by 2025–2026 and $1.60 or more by 2030.\n\nIn the near term, HBAR’s performance hinges on whether support at $0.217–$0.218 holds and if institutional demand continues to offset selling pressure around $0.225.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "The Web Needs a Better Model",
    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nMore than ever we are at the mercy of platform-based giants like Google and Amazon, who act as digital landlords. We have become cloud-serfs, giving our data and producing trillions in value for algorithms we will never own.\n\nOver 80% of Netflix viewing is dictated by its recommendation algorithm, and Amazon is far from a neutral marketplace — its matching engine gives preferential treatment to Amazon’s own products, and third-party sellers pay up to 50% of their revenue in fees for the privilege of competing for Amazon’s customers.\n\nThe promise of Web3 was a world beyond these digital landlords.\n\nWeb3, as defined by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014, was a \"post-Snowden web\" — an antidote to centralized control built on peer-to-peer trust.\n\nGavin’s architectural vision has been twisted.\n\nEthereum created “more individual millionaires than any other project” and together with the rest of the ICOs wave shifted the focus from technological principles to financial gains.\n\nBillions of dollars were channeled into speculative ICOs, up to 90% of which suffered major losses or became defunct within a year. This culminated in the 2021 bull market, where the crypto market cap briefly touched $3 trillion, and “Web3” was diluted into a catch-all marketing term to attract investors.\n\nThe mission of building a trustless, peer-to-peer internet would for a time being be buried under layers of hype.\n\nThe power of centralized platforms stems from their role as a trusted intermediary.\n\nYou trust Amazon to handle payments and arbitrate disputes with the sellers; you trust Google to vet, rank and present information. This trust-as-a-service model creates a golden cage: the intermediary owns the rules, the data and a significant cut of the value exchanged.\n\nEarly Web3 attempted to solve this problem with on-chain transactions, where every interaction is a public, permanent record. But this is like asking a global commerce system to run a single, congested highway. Real-world commerce requires an infrastructure that can match its speed and complexity — not everything should be an on-chain transaction.\n\nState channels present a superior infrastructure\n\nThink of a state channel as a high-speed, private lane between two parties that bypasses the congested blockchain. Thousands of interactions — value transfers, data permissions and contract updates — can happen instantaneously and for free, with each step cryptographically signed.\n\nThe primary barrier to peer-to-peer digital commerce has been the risk that one party won't fulfill their side of a deal. State channel (ERC-7824) design eliminates this risk without sacrificing efficiency. Before transacting, parties commit funds to an on-chain smart contract. This acts as a security deposit. If one party walks away, their committed on-chain funds ensure the other party is made whole. By settling profits and losses in near real-time, the system removes the need for a trusted central intermediary.\n\nThis combination of on-chain security and off-chain efficiency enables a new creation: the autonomous enterprise. This is a system where business logic is encoded onto smart contracts, executed transparently and operating globally without the need for a traditional corporate structure.\n\nBitcoin removed the need to trust the government’s money printing. Ethereum removed the need to trust people to enforce contracts. Now it’s time to remove the need for people to blindly trust platforms.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nCoinDesk 20 Performance Update: Bitcoin (BTC) Rises 1%, Leading Index Higher\n\nAave (AAVE) was also a top performer, gaining 1% from Tuesday.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, despite living in a world with the same bullish catalysts — easing monetary policy, ETF inflows, rising corporate adoption — hasn't been able to get out of its own way.\n\nThe action suggests bitcoin may not be able to move into a new sustained upswing until investors cool on the yellow metal.\n\nIndeed, gold Wednesday is having a rare day in the red — down 1.5% to $3,759 per ounce — perhaps \"allowing\" bitcoin to have what seems like an equally rare positive session, up 1.7% to $113,7000.\n\nWhile gold and bitcoin may seem to be moving in opposite directions in this stage of the cycle, logic would seem to dictate that both assets — given their appeal as hedges against excessive government spending and inflation — should at least kind of track over longer periods.\n\nThat appears to be the case. Year-to-date gold has gained 42% easily outpacing bitcoin's 22%, but at least showing both moving in the same direction. Going back to the start of 2024, gold is higher by 82% against bitcoin's 155% advance.\n\nAnd since the start of 2023, gold has more than doubled, while bitcoin is up more than six-fold (though that's measured from nearly the bottom of 2022's crypto winter).\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Advancing Private Credit with On-Chain Rails",
    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nPrivate credit, namely asset-backed finance (ABF), is among the fastest-growing corners of global finance. Already a $6.1 trillion market, Apollo Global Management sizes the addressable opportunity at over $20 trillion.\n\nYet despite its scale and growing role in financing businesses and consumers worldwide, the industry still runs on excel sheets. The result? Middle- and back-office bloat, cash drag and financing costs up to 30% higher than they should be.\n\nIt’s like tracking your working hours on a yellow sticky note, mailing it in and waiting 15 days to get paid in 2025. No one would tolerate this way of working.\n\nThese inefficiencies stem from how ABF is managed today.\n\nUnlike corporate credit, where the borrower’s full faith and balance sheet provide the anchor, ABF relies on the contractual cash flows of underlying assets: think BNPL loans, supply chain receivables or small business financing. To manage this complexity, funds like Apollo and Blackstone structure bespoke facilities for originators.\n\nThese originators can generate thousands of loan requests per month, but drawdowns typically happen weekly at best. In between, capital sits idle, investors absorb cash drag (i.e., the erosion of returns caused by capital sitting idle rather than being deployed into yield-generating loans) and originators resort to using costly equity dollars to bridge gaps.\n\nIncumbent managers deploy large operations teams to monitor covenants, verify collateral and manage waterfall payments. This is labor-intensive, error-prone and expensive.\n\nA transformative shift is now underway, set to accelerate ABF growth, and also where the web3 tech stack comes into play.\n\nAt the heart of this is not only better infrastructure enabled by blockchain, but also better money — better because it’s programmable.\n\nNew entrants can use programmable credit facilities and stablecoin rails to originate faster, fund cheaper and scale. By tokenizing credit facilities and embedding smart contracts into every step of the lifecycle, managers are able to automate verification, enforce compliance in real time and execute drawdowns and repayments instantly. Pairing that with programmable stablecoins for funding and settlement allows originators to eliminate cash drag. Platforms like Fence and Intain are already proving this works in practice — handling origination, reporting and payment waterfalls with code.\n\nSource: Fence.Finance\n\nThe implications are profound. Large managers like Apollo and Blackstone can shed operational bloat, while smaller funds, emerging managers and family offices can participate without needing armies of staff. On-chain infrastructure can ultimately help to democratize access to a market that has historically been closed off to all but the largest institutions. Over time, incumbents who remain tied to manual processes leveraging traditional rails risk losing ground to specialist credit funds adopting on-chain infrastructure.\n\nAmid renewed enthusiasm for crypto and the spotlight on stablecoin issuance, ABF is already applying the tech to solve real frictions and capture the rapidly expanding market opportunity. Watch this space.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nCoinDesk 20 Performance Update: Bitcoin (BTC) Rises 1%, Leading Index Higher\n\nAave (AAVE) was also a top performer, gaining 1% from Tuesday.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "The Protocol: Ethereum Developers Target December for Fusaka Hard Fork",
    "content": "This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nWelcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk.\n\nIn this issue:\n\nFUSAKA COMING THIS DECEMBER: Ethereum core developers have confirmed a tentative roadmap for the network’s next major upgrade, Fusaka, during an All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call. The upgrade, designed to further scale the blockchain, is now scheduled for early December, with follow-up changes aimed at more than doubling blob capacity in the weeks after. Before the Fusaka upgrade reaches Ethereum’s mainnet, developers will push the code through three public test networks in October. If those tests proceed smoothly, the mainnet activation is targeted for Dec. 3. Developers noted that exact epoch numbers and timing will be confirmed in the coming days. While Fusaka itself won’t immediately change blob parameters, the call outlined a phased approach to scaling blob availability through so-called Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks. One week after Fusaka BPO-1 will raise the blog target/max from 6/9 to 10/15, then one week later BPO-2 will push the limit to 14/21. These incremental changes are based on performance observed on the Fusaka Devnet-5 and are intended to safely expand capacity without requiring client-side software updates. Blobs, introduced in March’s Dencun upgrade, allow Ethereum to store large amounts of rollup transaction data more efficiently, reducing costs for users of layer-2 scaling networks. — Oliver Knight Read more.\n\nPLASMA BLOCKCHAIN FOR STABLECOINS COMING: Plasma, a new blockchain built specifically for stablecoins, is set to flip the switch on its long-awaited mainnet beta, introducing the chain and its native token, XPL, on Sept. 25. According to a blog post from the team, the network will debut with more than $2 billion in stablecoin liquidity from over a hundred partners on day one — an aggressive attempt to position Plasma not as just another general-purpose chain, but as the backbone for stablecoin transfers. That won’t be an easy feat. Ethereum and Solana already dominate stablecoin volumes, while newer chains continue to optimize for similar flows. Plasma’s bet is that its architecture, dubbed PlasmaBFT, will give it an edge. The system is designed for fast, composable stablecoin transactions the team said, and from launch, users will be able to move USDT with zero fees through Plasma’s dashboard — a feature the team hopes will stand out in a crowded DeFi landscape.Token distribution is also aimed at broad accessibility. Prior to launch, 10% of XPL was sold in a public offering.

Announced at XRPL Seoul 2025 on Monday and pitched as the first liquid-staking product tied directly to the XRP ecosystem, the product is minted on XRPL’s EVM through audited contracts.

This could be the beginning of a new tech stack - one in which AI, not humans, becomes the primary developer of applications, according to Dominic Williams, founder of Internet Computer developer Dfinity. Williams argued that while crypto prices remain driven largely by market mechanics - treasury operations, liquidity games and speculation - the underlying technology will eventually force a reckoning in an interview with CoinDesk. “In the long run, markets begin to reflect realities on the ground,” he said. “But as yet you’re not seeing what’s happening with Internet Computer reflected in ICP’s price.” The Internet Computer first demonstrated neural networks running as smart contracts in April last year, starting with image classification and later facial recognition, Williams said. While those were relatively simple models compared to large language models - the kind that power AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini - they were proof of concept: that AI can run natively on a blockchain. No other network has achieved this, Williams pointed out, despite the chatter about “decentralized AI.” Where others rely on off-chain infrastructure like Amazon Web Services, ICP seeks to integrate the full AI development and execution stack on-chain. Williams describes this as “a self-writing internet” - a system where users describe what they want, and an AI delivers it as a working application, hosted directly on Internet Computer. The bigger idea, Williams said, is that AI itself will replace much of today’s developer workflow. – Jamie Crawley Read more.\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "content": "Ethereum core developers have confirmed a tentative roadmap for the network’s next major upgrade, Fusaka, during Thursday’s All Core Developers Consensus (ACDC) call.\n\nThe upgrade, designed to further scale the blockchain, is now scheduled for early December, with follow-up changes aimed at more than doubling blob capacity in the weeks after.\n\nBefore the Fusaka upgrade reaches Ethereum’s mainnet, developers will push the code through three public test networks in October.\n\nIf those tests proceed smoothly, the mainnet activation is targeted for Dec. 3. Developers noted that exact epoch numbers and timing will be confirmed in the coming days.\n\nWhile Fusaka itself won’t immediately change blob parameters, the call outlined a phased approach to scaling blob availability through so-called Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks.\n\nOne week after Fusaka BPO-1 will raise the blog target/max from 6/9 to 10/15, then one week later BPO-2 will push the limit to 14/21.\n\nThese incremental changes are based on performance observed on the Fusaka Devnet-5 and are intended to safely expand capacity without requiring client-side software updates.\n\nBlobs, introduced in March’s Dencun upgrade, allow Ethereum to store large amounts of rollup transaction data more efficiently, reducing costs for users of layer-2 scaling networks.\n\nEthereum researcher Christine Kim, who reported the call highlights on X, noted that additional BPOs remain on the roadmap for Fusaka, although only the first two were scheduled in this week’s call.\n\nA detailed timeline of the Fusaka and BPO activations is available via Ethereum’s public notes.\n\nThe Fusaka rollout follows May’s Pectra upgrade, which introduced validator staking changes and new account abstraction features, underscoring Ethereum’s ongoing push to optimize scalability and network efficiency.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Ethereum and Solana already dominate stablecoin volumes, while newer chains continue to optimize for similar flows. Plasma’s bet is that its architecture, dubbed PlasmaBFT, will give it an edge. The system is designed for fast, composable stablecoin transactions the team said, and from launch, users will be able to move USDT with zero fees through Plasma’s dashboard — a feature the team hopes will stand out in a crowded DeFi landscape.\n\nToken distribution is also aimed at broad accessibility. Prior to launch, 10% of XPL was sold in a public offering. At launch, 25 million tokens will be allocated to the community, with another 2.5 million reserved for members of the so-called Stablecoin Collective.\n\nBacking the project are heavyweights from the crypto and venture worlds: the $24 million in seed and Series A funding was led by Framework Ventures, with participation from Bitfinex, Peter Thiel and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, among others.\n\n“Plasma’s mission is to become the foundation for global money movement.

ICP’s design, with features like “reverse gas” - the model where developers pay for the computational costs of their applications, rather than requiring end users to pay a transaction fee - removes the need for firewalls or database migrations that plague traditional infrastructure.\n\n“AI is developing these apps hundreds of times faster than humans could,” Williams said. “And because there are no system admins standing by, you need the guardrails only blockchain can provide.”\n\nWilliams pointed to early hackathons where ordinary people used AI on ICP to build apps: from a crowdsourced pothole-mapping platform, to a tool for generating wills and health directives.\n\nThe vision is that such tools could proliferate in the millions. Entrepreneurs, small businesses and even NGOs could create customized apps without technical expertise, paying for usage with fiat while crypto tokens underpin the system behind the scenes.\n\nDespite these developments, the ICP token has yet to see sustained momentum. It briefly rallied when AI integrations were announced last year, but has since traded more in line with broader market sentiment than with user adoption.\n\nWilliams accepts this disconnect but predicts that markets may catch up very soon.\n\n“This could be the first time Web3 actually outcompetes Web2 technologically, without a token incentive in sight,” Williams said. “The shock will be when people realize they can just talk to an AI, and a blockchain app appears at a URL.”\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

That's two straight months of bearish put bias.\n\nIn other words, traders have consistently favored protective puts over bullish calls for two months, signaling a sustained cautious or risk-averse outlook.\n\nA similar put option bias was observed from March 8 to April 21 this year, a period marked by sharp declines in both the spot price and IBIT, primarily driven by the trade war-induced weakness on Wall Street.\n\nIBIT’s price trend has stalled since July, failing multiple times to rise above the $70 level. Recently, it formed a \"lower high\" at $66, meaning the recent peak price was lower than the previous high near $70.\n\nThis pattern signals weakening buying pressure and suggests that sellers are gaining strength.

    "content": "Bitcoin's\nBTC\n$122,771.35\nbreak below key support has prompted a flurry of 'buy the dip' calls on social media. However, liquidity trends suggest a potential for a deeper decline.\n\nBTC has dropped over 3% to $111,590 this week, piercing the widely-tracked 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMA). Both indicators have lost their upward momentum for the first time since April, now flatlining to signal caution for bulls.\n\nMeanwhile, mentions of \"buy the dip\" on social media have surged to their highest level in nearly a month, a telltale sign of bullish sentiment among retail investors, according to data tracking platform Santiment. The platform tracks \"buy the dip\" mentions using its social trends indicator, which analyses the volume of relevant keywords and phrases across Reddit, Telegram and X (formerly Twitter).\n\nA spike in these mentions is considered a contrarian signal by Santiment, meaning the ongoing price pullback in BTC could deepen.\n\n\"Prices typically move [in] the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations. So if retail traders believe that $112,200 is finally the time to buy, then a little more pain needs to be felt. Once the crowd stops feeling optimistic, and they begin to sell their bags at a loss, this is typically the time to strike with your dip buys,\" Santiment said in a market analysis note.\n\nAnalysis of order book liquidity also suggests scope for a continued move lower.\n\nAccording to Hyblock Capital, the deepest liquidity cluster, marked by concentration of buy/sell orders, is seen at $107,000. The level can act as a magnet, pulling the price down, Hyblock explained on X.\n\nOrder book liquidity refers to the concentration and availability of buy and sell orders at different price levels in the order book for a specific asset. It reflects market depth and liquidity by showing the volume available to buy or sell at each price.\n\nLarge liquidity levels, such as $107,000, can effectively absorb incoming supply and demand, helping to stabilize prices. Additionally, traders often place buy orders near these levels, anticipating a price bounce, which creates a self-reinforcing support effect.\n\nAccording to Hyblock, smaller but growing liquidity pools are also seen at $109,000 and $111,000.\n\nRead more: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF: Bearish Sentiment in IBIT Stays Strong for Two Straight Months\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

As the confirmation process for Quintenz remains mired in delays and some open conflict, Pham has been regularly announcing initiatives as part of a \"crypto sprint\" and working with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins.\n\n\"For years I have said that collateral management is the ‘killer app’ for stablecoins in markets,\" Pham said in a Tuesday statement. \"I’m excited to announce the launch of this initiative to work closely with stakeholders to enable the use of tokenized collateral including stablecoins.\"\n\nPham had been pushing since last year for a so-called regulatory sandbox for tokenization, when she served as a commissioner during the previous administration, and when she took over as acting chairman, she announced the pursuit of a pilot program on stablecoin-backed tokenization.\n\nStablecoins, newly regulated under the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) Act, are the dollar-based tokens that are key to the plumbing of crypto markets and smart-contract-driven digital finance.

Treasury is seeking comment on all aspects of the ANPRM from all interested parties and also requests commenters to identify other issues that Treasury should consider.\n\nComments on this ANPRM must be received on or before October 20, 2025.\n\nWritten comments may be submitted through one of two methods:\n\nWe encourage comments to be submitted via https://www.regulations.gov. All comments should be captioned with “GENIUS Act Implementation Comments.” Please include your name, organizational affiliation, address, email address, and telephone number in your comment. All comments received, including attachments and other supporting materials, will be part of the public record and subject to public disclosure. Do not submit any information in your comment or supporting materials that you consider confidential or inappropriate for public disclosure.\n\nTian Huang and Shane Shannon, Counselors to the General Counsel; Christina Lee, Senior Counsel; Degi Altantuya, Frank Colleluori, Brendan Costello, Matan Neuman, Carol Rodrigues, and David Wertime, Attorney-Advisors, Office of the General Counsel, OGC_GeniusAct@Treasury.gov, 202-622-0480, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20220.\n\nThe GENIUS Act, enacted on July 18, 2025, provides a comprehensive framework for the federal regulation of payment stablecoins.[1] As defined in the GENIUS Act, a payment stablecoin is a digital asset [2] (i) that is, or is designed to be, used as a means of payment or settlement and (ii) the issuer of which is obligated to convert, redeem, or repurchase for a fixed amount of monetary value and represents or creates the reasonable expectation that it will maintain a stable value relative to a fixed amount of monetary value.[3] U.S. dollar-denominated (USD) stablecoins seek to combine the accessibility and frictionless use of digital assets with the stability and benefits of a USD-based financial system.[4]\n\nUnder the GENIUS Act, only permitted payment stablecoin issuers (PPSIs) may issue a payment stablecoin in the United States, subject to certain exceptions and safe harbors.[5] Further, beginning on July 18, 2028, digital asset service providers [6] may not offer or sell ( printed page 45160)\na payment stablecoin to any person in the United States unless the payment stablecoin is issued by a PPSI or issued by a foreign payment stablecoin issuer (FPSI) that meets certain requirements.[7] The GENIUS Act provides three primary categories of PPSIs, all of which must be formed in the United States: (i) a subsidiary of an insured depository institution; (ii) a federal qualified payment stablecoin issuer; or (iii) a state qualified stablecoin issuer.[8]\n\nThe GENIUS Act vests Treasury with various authorities and responsibilities, including express authority to issue regulations to carry out the GENIUS Act.[9] For example, Treasury is tasked with implementing limitations on the issuance of payment stablecoins in the United States,[10] as well as issuing rules establishing broad-based principles for determining whether a state-level regulatory regime is substantially similar to the federal regulatory framework.[11] The GENIUS Act calls on Treasury to issue regulations implementing the requirement that PPSIs are “subject to all Federal laws applicable to a U.S. financial institution located in the United States relating to economic sanctions, prevention of money laundering, customer identification and due diligence.” [12] Treasury is also tasked with determining whether a foreign country's regulatory and supervisory regime is comparable to the U.S. framework established through the GENIUS Act, which would allow certain payment stablecoins issued by an FPSI to be offered or sold in the United States, subject to certain additional conditions.[13]\n\nIn addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (collectively, the Primary Federal Payment Stablecoin Regulators) are generally tasked with implementing capital and liquidity requirements applicable to PPSIs,[14] and establishing a process and framework for the licensing, regulation, examination, and supervision of PPSIs,[15] as well as associated regulations governing depository institutions that hold stablecoin reserves or otherwise participate in payment stablecoin activities,[16] among other directives.\n\nUnder the GENIUS Act, the Secretary of the Treasury chairs the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee (SCRC), an interagency committee that also includes the Chair of the FRB (or the Vice Chair for Supervision, if delegated by the FRB Chair) and Chair of the FDIC.[17] State qualified payment stablecoin issuers (of payment stablecoins with consolidated total outstanding issuance of up to $10 billion) generally may opt for state regulation so long as the state regime is substantially similar to the federal regime and the SCRC has approved the state-level regulatory regime upon determining that it meets or exceeds the standards and requirements set forth in Section 4(a) of the GENIUS Act.[18]\n\nWhile not addressed in the GENIUS Act, Treasury also has responsibility for federal income tax policy with respect to payment stablecoins, as part of its general responsibility for developing and implementing federal tax policies and programs.\n\nThis ANPRM solicits public comments on topics and questions organized in six main categories: Stablecoin Issuers and Service Providers, Illicit Finance, Foreign Payment Stablecoin Regimes, Taxation, Insurance, and Economic Data. While this ANPRM invites comment on any aspect of the GENIUS Act, each section below includes specific questions. Commenters are not expected to respond to every question. Treasury generally expects to invite further public comment on proposed regulations before adopting any final regulations.\n\nThis ANPRM generally seeks information on topics that may be the subject of regulations issued by Treasury under the GENIUS Act to fulfill its responsibilities, including as chair of the SCRC. For administrative purposes, commenters should direct to other relevant agencies any comments on specific topics assigned by the GENIUS Act to other agencies, rather than include those comments in response to this ANPRM. However, commenters are encouraged to identify, in their comments in response to this ANPRM, areas where Treasury's regulations may overlap with or directly implicate the regulations assigned to other state or federal agencies.\n\nAs discussed further below, on August 18, 2025, Treasury issued a request for comment (RFC) relating to innovative methods, techniques, and strategies that financial institutions use, or have the potential to use, to detect illicit finance related to digital assets pursuant to Section 9 of the GENIUS Act.[19] Comments submitted in response to the RFC should not be submitted in response to this ANPRM.\n\nThe GENIUS Act tasks Treasury with issuing regulations to implement Section 3 of the GENIUS Act.[20] That section, which is intended to have extraterritorial effect,[21] provides that it shall be unlawful for any person other than a PPSI to issue a payment stablecoin in the United States.[22] However, the GENIUS Act provides that Treasury may issue regulations providing safe harbors from this general limitation that are: (i) consistent with the purposes of the GENIUS Act; (ii) limited in scope; and (iii) apply to a de minimis volume of transactions, as determined by Treasury.[23] Treasury may also provide limited safe harbors if it determines that unusual and exigent circumstances exist.[24] Knowing participation in a violation of Section 3 can result in a fine of not more than $1 million for each violation or imprisonment for up to five years, or both.[25]\n\n1. What topics should any regulations to effectuate Section 3(a), including the associated penalties, address?\n\n2. Should Treasury issue regulations providing for safe harbors from Section 3(a)? If so, what factors should Treasury consider in adopting these regulations? Would it be better to observe the operation of Section 3(a) for a period of time before considering safe harbors, or are safe harbors necessary as soon as Section 3(a) becomes operational? ( printed page 45161)\n\n3. Is the scope of the term “payment stablecoin” sufficiently clear as defined in the GENIUS Act? If not, what additional clarification should be provided?\n\nSection 3(b) of the GENIUS Act provides that, beginning three years after the enactment of the GENIUS Act (July 18, 2028), it shall generally be unlawful for a digital asset service provider to offer or sell a payment stablecoin to a person in the United States unless the stablecoin is issued by a PPSI.[26] Section 3(e) provides that these provisions are intended to have extraterritorial effect if conduct involves the offer or sale of a payment stablecoin to a person located in the United States.\n\n4. Is the scope of the term “digital asset service provider” sufficiently clear as defined in the GENIUS Act? If not, what additional clarification should be provided?\n\n5. Is the extraterritorial application sufficiently clear as stated in the GENIUS Act? If not, what additional clarification should be provided?\n\nSection 3(g) of the GENIUS Act provides that a payment stablecoin not issued by a PPSI shall not be: (i) treated as cash or as a cash equivalent for accounting purposes; (ii) eligible as cash or as a cash equivalent margin and collateral for certain regulated entities; or (iii) acceptable as a settlement asset to facilitate certain wholesale payments.\n\n6. How should payment stablecoins not issued by a PPSI be treated for accounting purposes under Section 3(g)(1)?\n\n7. Are any regulations or guidance necessary to clarify any aspects of this treatment provision?\n\nSection 3(h) of the GENIUS Act provides that the following transactions are exempt from the prohibitions in Section 3: (i) the direct transfer of digital assets between two individuals acting on their own behalf and for their own lawful purposes, without the involvement of an intermediary; (ii) any transaction involving the receipt of digital assets by an individual between an account owned by the individual in the United States and an account owned by the individual abroad that are offered by the same parent company; or (iii) any transaction by means of a software or hardware wallet that facilitates an individual's own custody of digital assets.\n\n8. Are any regulations or guidance necessary to clarify the scope of these exempted transactions?\n\n9. Are there any other terms in Section 3 that would benefit from additional clarification or interpretation?\n\nSection 4(a)(1)(A) of the GENIUS Act establishes reserve requirements for stablecoins. Under Section 4(a)(1)(C) of the GENIUS Act, a PPSI is required to publish the monthly composition of the issuer's reserves, containing (i) the total number of outstanding payment stablecoins issued by the issuer, and (ii) the amount and composition of its reserves, including the average tenor and geographic location of custody of each category of reserve instruments. Section 18(a)(3) of the GENIUS Act requires an FPSI to hold reserves in a U.S. financial institution sufficient to meet liquidity demands of U.S. customers, unless otherwise permitted under a reciprocal arrangement, among other requirements.\n\n10. Are any regulations or guidance necessary to clarify the scope of the reserve requirements in Section 4(a) or the requirement to publish the composition of the reserves?\n\n11. How will FPSIs determine the liquidity demands of U.S. customers in such a way that will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the obligation to hold reserves in U.S. financial institutions as set forth in Section 18(a)(3)?\n\n12. Are any regulations necessary to clarify requirements related to the holding of reserve assets? In particular, is additional clarity necessary regarding the extent to which reserve assets are required to, or should, be held in custody?\n\n13. How do market participants currently meet existing jurisdictional reserve requirements to minimize settlement or liquidity risk across jurisdictions that may require local custody of such reserve assets?\n\nSection 4(a)(11) of the GENIUS Act prohibits PPSIs and FPSIs from paying the holder of any payment stablecoin any form of interest or yield (whether in cash, tokens, or other consideration) solely in connection with the holding, use, or retention of such payment stablecoin.\n\n14. Should any regulations be issued to clarify the meaning of “pay,” “interest,” “yield,” “solely,” or otherwise clarify the scope of Section 4(a)(11)? In particular, should any regulations be issued to clarify whether, and to what extent, any indirect payments are prohibited?\n\nSection 4(a)(9) of the GENIUS Act prohibits a PPSI from marketing a payment stablecoin in such a way that a reasonable person would perceive the payment stablecoin to be (i) legal tender, (ii) issued by the United States, or (iii) guaranteed or approved by the government of the United States. Abbreviations directly relating to the currency to which a payment stablecoin is pegged, such as “USD,” are exempt from these prohibitions.\n\n15. Are any regulations or guidance necessary to clarify the scope or application of these provisions, including whether other terms used by PPSIs may be deceptive?\n\nUnder Section 4(a)(12) of the GENIUS Act, certain non-financial companies may not issue payment stablecoins unless the SCRC unanimously votes to make certain findings, including that it will not pose a material risk to the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system, the financial stability of the United States, or the Deposit Insurance Fund. Section 4(a)(12)(D) directs the SCRC to issue an interpretive rule clarifying the non-financial company restrictions.\n\n16. What additional clarification is necessary on the scope or application of these restrictions?\n\n17. What factors should the SCRC consider in making a finding that, if a non-financial company issues payment stablecoins, it will not pose a material risk to the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system, the financial stability of the United States, or the Deposit Insurance Fund? Are there any factors that should be excluded from consideration?\n\nUnder Section 4(c)(2) of the GENIUS Act, Treasury is required to establish broad-based principles for determining whether a state-level regulatory regime is substantially similar to the federal regulatory framework under the GENIUS Act.\n\n18. What broad-based principles should be considered in determining whether a state-level regime is “substantially similar” to the federal regulatory framework? Are there any principles that should be excluded from consideration?\n\n19. How is a determination that a state-level regime is “substantially similar” to the federal regulatory framework, as described in Sections 4(c)(1) and (2) of the GENIUS Act, similar to or different from a determination that a state-level regime “meets or exceeds the standards and requirements” for issuing payment stablecoins, as described in Section 4(c)(5)?\n\nSection 4(e)(3) of the GENIUS Act provides that it shall be unlawful to market a product in the United States as a payment stablecoin unless the product is issued pursuant to the GENIUS Act, ( printed page 45162)\nand that knowing and willful violations may lead to a fine by Treasury of not more than $500,000 for each such violation.\n\n20. To what extent does this prohibition overlap with (i) the prohibitions in Section 3, (ii) the prohibition on the use of deceptive names in Section 4(a)(9), or (iii) the prohibition on misrepresentation of insured status in Section 4(e)(2)?\n\n21. Are any regulations or guidance necessary to clarify or implement this provision, including how the number of violations will be determined under Section 4(e)(3)(C)?\n\n22. Are there any other terms in Section 4 that would benefit from additional clarification or interpretation?\n\nThe GENIUS Act includes provisions relating to the detection and prevention of illicit finance in the digital asset sector.[27] In accordance with Section 9 of the GENIUS Act, on August 18, 2025, Treasury published in the Federal Register an RFC seeking input on innovative or novel methods, techniques, or strategies that regulated financial institutions use, or have potential to use, to detect illicit activity. Treasury will consider comments submitted in response to either the RFC or this ANPRM, so commenters need not, and should not, resubmit any RFC comments in response to this ANPRM. In addition to topics addressed in the RFC, Treasury now requests comment on the following topics relating to illicit finance.\n\nSection 4(a)(5) of the GENIUS Act subjects PPSIs to “all Federal laws applicable to financial institutions located in the United States relating to economic sanctions, prevention of money laundering, customer identification and due diligence,” and directs Treasury to issue implementing regulations, including related to effective programs for AML and sanctions, monitoring and reporting suspicious activity, and technical capabilities and policies and procedures to block, freeze, and reject impermissible transactions.[28]\n\n23. What should Treasury consider when promulgating regulations implementing Section 4(a)(5), including AML and sanctions programs, monitoring and reporting suspicious activity, and customer identification and due diligence? What, if any, unique features of PPSIs should Treasury consider?\n\n24. What should Treasury consider when promulgating a regulation implementing Section 4(a)(5)(A)(iv)? How do payment stablecoin issuers anticipate implementing technical capabilities, policies, and procedures to block, freeze, and reject specific or impermissible transactions that violate federal or state laws, rules, or regulations, including transactions involving the secondary market, such as those that involve sanctioned persons or countries?\n\nSection 4(a)(6)(B) of the GENIUS Act provides that a PPSI may issue payment stablecoins only if the issuer has the technological capability to comply, and will comply, with the terms of any lawful order.[29]\n\n25. What, if any, regulations or guidance would help clarify the obligations in Section 4(a)(6)(B) to have the technological capability to comply, and to comply, with any lawful order?\n\nThe GENIUS Act establishes that foreign issuers of payment stablecoins must comply with lawful orders and, if they fail to do so, Treasury can designate the issuer as noncompliant, resulting in a prohibition on digital asset service providers facilitating secondary market trading of the foreign issuer's payment stablecoin.[30] Treasury can issue licenses and waivers and is directed to specify the criteria that a noncompliant foreign issuer must meet for Treasury to determine that an issuer is no longer noncompliant.[31]\n\n26. What factors should Treasury consider in determining whether a noncompliant FPSI has cured its noncompliance in accordance with Section 8(b)(3)? What kinds of evidence or commitments should Treasury require?\n\n27. What else should Treasury consider in promulgating a regulation related to Section 8 of the GENIUS Act, including its ability to issue licenses and waivers?\n\n28. In the economic sanctions context, lawful orders will include sanctions designations. The persons and property subject to blocking will be identified with reasonable particularity by the publication of identifying information for such persons and property on Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals List. If regulation or guidance is promulgated, what kind of considerations and provisions should it include to clarify the requirement to comply with lawful orders in the economic sanctions context?\n\nThe GENIUS Act allows an FPSI to offer, sell, or otherwise make available a payment stablecoin in the United States under certain circumstances. To implement this framework, the GENIUS Act authorizes Treasury to determine whether a foreign [32] regime for the regulation and supervision of payment stablecoins is comparable to the requirements established under the GENIUS Act, allowing certain payment stablecoins issued by an FPSI operating under that foreign regime to be offered or sold in the United States, subject to certain additional conditions.[33] Some foreign jurisdictions may not have legal definitions for either a “payment stablecoin” or a “payment stablecoin issuer.”\n\n29. For the purpose of identifying existing foreign payment stablecoin regulatory and supervisory regimes, are there certain characteristics of a “payment stablecoin” recognized in the market that differ from how this term is defined in the GENIUS Act?\n\n30. Are there foreign payment stablecoin regulatory or supervisory regimes, or regimes in development, that may be comparable to the regime established under the GENIUS Act? Are there foreign regimes that are in effect, or in development, that materially differ from the regime under the GENIUS Act?\n\n31. What types of differences from the regime under the GENIUS Act, if any, could create market frictions in international digital assets activity?\n\n32. As Treasury identifies factors for determining whether a foreign jurisdiction has a regulatory and supervisory regime that is comparable to the requirements established under the GENIUS Act, including standards for issuing payment stablecoins provided in Section 4(a), what specific factors should Treasury consider, including factors that should disqualify a foreign jurisdiction from being determined to be comparable? Are there factors that should be excluded from consideration?\n\n33. To what extent should Treasury consider a foreign jurisdiction's willingness and ability to enforce the prohibitions in Sections 4(a)(9), 4(e)(2), and 4(e)(3), as related to misrepresentations of U.S. government support or that of the foreign government, as a factor in comparability determinations under Section 18(b)? ( printed page 45163)\n\n34. How should Treasury interpret “interoperability” in Section 18(d)(1)(C), describing “interoperability with U.S.-dollar denominated payment stablecoins issued overseas?” What technical, legal, regulatory, or other measures are most relevant for interoperability? To what extent should compliance with any interoperability standards issued under Section 12 be required under reciprocal arrangements or other agreements entered into under Section 18(d)?\n\n35. What information should U.S. authorities require from a FPSI registered under Section 18(c), and in what format(s) should such information be made available, to ensure that U.S. customers understand how to demand timely redemption of the instrument?\n\n36. Are any regulations or guidance necessary to clarify the prohibition on offers and sales of payment stablecoins issued by foreign issuers in the United States under Section 3(b)(2) of the GENIUS Act, including the requirement that an FPSI have the “technological capability” for compliance?\n\nThe GENIUS Act does not address the federal income tax characterization of payment stablecoins or any other issues relevant to the application of the Internal Revenue Code to payment stablecoin transactions. The characterization of a financial instrument or other asset for federal income tax purposes in many cases determines or affects how it is taxed. For example, if payment stablecoins were treated as debt instruments for federal income tax purposes, they could be subject to various tax rules governing bonds or securities.[34]\n\n37. To what extent would guidance from the IRS on the classification of payment stablecoins be necessary or helpful to taxpayers?\n\n38. What other topics, if any, should any such tax guidance address? Which issues should be the highest priority items to address?\n\nThe following questions are intended to assist Treasury in evaluating how the GENIUS Act and its implementation may affect the insurance industry.\n\n39. How should implementation of the GENIUS Act take into account insurance industry practices related to payment stablecoins, the development of insurance markets related to payment stablecoins, the activities of domestic and foreign insurers and reinsurers regarding payment stablecoins, and the provision of insurance coverages relevant to payment stablecoins?\n\n40. How should GENIUS Act implementation take into account the types and amounts of insurance coverage that should be purchased by PPSIs or FPSIs?\n\n41. What should Treasury consider regarding the possibility of insurers acting as PPSIs, FPSIs, or digital asset service providers, including with respect to insurance reserving practices and regulatory requirements?\n\n42. What other topics should Treasury consider with respect to the impact of the GENIUS Act and its implementation on the insurance industry? Which issues should be the highest priority items for Treasury to consider?\n\nThe following questions are intended to assist Treasury in analyses that it may perform regarding the potential costs and benefits of certain regulations related to the GENIUS Act.\n\n43. What are the estimated one-time and ongoing costs for PPSIs and FPSIs to comply with the requirements under the GENIUS Act, including licensing, disclosure, and AML and sanctions program requirements?\n\n44. What are the expected legal and enforcement costs for PPSIs and FPSIs associated with GENIUS Act compliance, including litigation-related expenses?\n\n45. What are the potential costs associated with registration under state regimes as compared to federal regimes, including any administrative burdens or impacts on innovation?\n\n46. What are the potential advantages of registering under state regimes compared to federal regimes, particularly in terms of administrative efficiency and support for innovation?\n\n47. The GENIUS Act establishes federal safeguards to protect consumers. How should the economic benefits of consumer protection be measured?\n\n48. How do you expect illicit finance activity involving payment stablecoins and efforts to combat that activity to change due to GENIUS Act requirements for PPSIs related to AML and sanctions?\n\n49. What are the economic benefits of aligning U.S. stablecoin rules with foreign regimes (e.g., reduced friction and increased access)?\n\n50. What is the estimated improvement in compliance efficiency and market participation due to clearer regulatory guidance as compared to the environment before the enactment of the GENIUS Act?\n\n51. What is the projected impact of regulatory clarity on startup formation, venture investment, and product innovation?\n\n52. What is the estimated impact from the adoption of payment stablecoins on transaction, processing, and settlement fees, failure rates, and timelines, as compared to existing payments systems?\n\n53. What is the estimated impact of PPSIs and FPSIs on the demand for Treasury securities, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that are eligible reserve assets under Sec. 4(a)(1)(A)?\n\n54. Are any regulations or guidance necessary to address risks associated with the resolution of a bankrupt or failed PPSI, including those that may have stablecoins in international circulation?\n\n55. What types of conflicts of interest might arise for stablecoin issuers, and what safeguards might enable stakeholders to be confident in a fair market?\n\n56. Which of the topics addressed in this ANPRM are most critical for establishing the GENIUS Act regulatory framework? Are there any other factors Treasury should consider in sequencing and prioritizing these rulemakings?\n\n57. Are there other topics not addressed in this ANPRM that should be considered in future Treasury rulemakings?\n\n58. What is the projected impact of regulatory clarity on demand for payment stablecoins?\n\nThis ANPRM is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. It has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nRachel Miller,\n\nExecutive Secretary, U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\n1.  Public Law 119-27.\n\n2.  The term “digital asset” means any digital representation of value that is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger.

    "title": "U.S. Treasury Takes Next Step in Turning GENIUS Act Into Stablecoin Regulations",
    "content": "The U.S. Treasury Department is pushing forward with a narrow comment window on its preliminary, formal efforts to solidify the recently established stablecoin law into a set of regulations.\n\nThis arm of President Donald Trump's administration has opened what's known as an \"advance notice of proposed rulemaking\" on Friday, which is an early step taken to gather information that will be used to put together an actual proposal. In this case, the government is asking for data on building out its requirements under the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) Act, including prohibitions on issuers, sanctions obligations, anti-money laundering compliance, the balance between state and federal oversight, tax matters and any further need from the industry for clarity.\n\nA one-month period is now open in which the public — and crypto businesses — can weigh in on these complex issues before it closes on October 20. The notice posted dozens of questions, such as, \"Is additional clarity necessary regarding the extent to which reserve assets are required to, or should, be held in custody?\" and \"Are there foreign payment stablecoin regulatory or supervisory regimes, or regimes in development, that may be comparable to the regime established under the GENIUS Act?\"\n\nThe Treasury Department's role in GENIUS is varied, including requirements to address sanctions compliance, tax treatments and how foreign jurisdictions will interact with U.S. regulations. The Friday action is meant to build on a less formal effort announced last month to start gathering input on how best to detect illicit activity in crypto.\n\nThe GENIUS Act was the first major U.S. crypto legislation to become law, and it marked a huge win for the industry, which has shifted focus now onto an even bigger legislative effort to establish rules for the wider industry. That market structure bill is a focus of lawmakers from both parties in the Senate, who are also in talks with their House of Representatives counterparts who already approved a similar bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and atop the federal financial regulators are trying to speed ahead to meet orders from President Trump to establish friendly crypto regulations that will help the U.S. become a global hub for the sector.\n\nAlso on Friday, JP Morgan said in a research note that the overall crypto market needs to expand significantly for continued growth in the stablecoin sector, or new stablecoins may start cannibalizing each other.\n\nRead More: U.S. Treasury Department Starts Work on GENIUS, Gathering Views on Illicit Activity\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "The Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals",
    "content": "This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nWelcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk.\n\nIn this issue:\n\nBITCOIN HOLDERS HESITANT TO EXPLORE BTC DEFI : Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as BTCFi, has been touted as the next wave of innovation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, research suggests bitcoin holders themselves are barely engaging. Some 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending. The survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector’s promise and its actual reach. “There’s an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,” said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement. That appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector’s trust and complexity problem. — Jamie Crawley Read more.\n\nETHEREUM FUSAKA UPGRADE ON HOLESKY TESTNET GOES LIVE: Ethereum’s next upgrade, Fusaka, just moved closer to going live on the main blockchain after a successful test run on the Holesky test network last week. The Fusaka hard fork comes only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade and is designed to make things cheaper for institutions using Ethereum. One of the changes it introduces is PeerDAS, a feature that lets validators check only part of the data needed instead of full chunks (“blobs”), which helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Test networks like Holesky act as practice grounds where developers can safely test new code before it reaches the real chain. Holesky, launched in 2023, was particularly important because its validator setup closely mirrors Ethereum’s mainnet. But over the past few months, Holesky has started showing signs of age and reliability issues. Fusaka is the last upgrade the network will see before it shuts down — two weeks after Fusaka goes live on mainnet. The next two testnet runs are scheduled for October 14 and 28. After those are complete, Ethereum developers will lock in a date for Fusaka’s full mainnet launch. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nDOUBLEZERO MAINNET GOES LIVE: A new project wants to give blockchains their own “fast lane” on the internet. The DoubleZero Foundation announced that its highly anticipated mainnet-beta is live. DoubleZero is a network built to speed up how blockchain validators talk to each other. Instead of relying on the public internet, which can sometimes be slow and unpredictable, Solana validators can now connect through DoubleZero’s fiber routes, which let users transact faster. In simple terms, DoubleZero is like a private highway system for blockchains. While normal internet routes are designed to be cheap and broad, they aren’t built for the split-second coordination thousands of blockchain nodes need. DoubleZero says its network reduces lag and makes it easier for validators to process transactions and stay in sync, which could improve both performance and reliability for end users. The project has already seen early adoption. Currently, 22% of staked SOL is plugged into the DoubleZero network. Big industry names like Jump Crypto, Galaxy, RockawayX, and Jito are contributing fiber links and engineering resources, betting that faster internet infrastructure will pay off as blockchain applications scale. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nBEE MAPS RAISES $32M IN FUNDING ROUND: Bee Maps, the decentralized mapping project powered by Hivemapper, has raised $32 million in fresh funding to expand its global contributor network and scale its infrastructure, it announced this week. The round was led by Pantera Capital, LDA Capital, Borderless Capital and Ajna Capital, marking one of the largest financings in the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) sector this year. Bee Maps is an application on the Hivemapper network, which is one of the largest decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) focused on mapping data on Solana. Hivemapper enables drivers to contribute data through AI-enabled dash cams, which detect real-time changes on roads (like new signs on the roads, detours, or construction zones), ensuring digital maps can update quickly to stay accurate. Bee Maps leverages this infrastructure by rewarding contributors with its native token, $HONEY, for collecting street-level imagery. The raise highlights strong investor appetite for Bee Maps’ vision of real-time, AI-powered maps. In recent months, Bee Maps has teamed up with major players including Lyft and Volkswagen’s robotaxi program to bring its mapping-data to their platforms. The fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features and boost contributor incentives tied to $HONEY. – Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nMore For You\n\nEthereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Could Cut Node Costs, Ease Adoption\n\nFusaka – a blend of the names Fulu and Osaka – consists of two simultaneous upgrades to Ethereum’s consensus and execution layers, respectively.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Stellar’s native token XLM experienced heightened volatility over the past 24 hours, fluctuating between $0.38 and $0.39 — a 3% range — before closing near session highs. After dipping to $0.38 early on Oct. 8, the asset mounted a swift recovery, regaining ground above $0.39 by the end of the period, suggesting robust buying activity at lower levels.\n\nDuring the most recent hour of trading, XLM again demonstrated pronounced short-term swings, plunging briefly to $0.38 before rebounding sharply to reclaim the $0.39 mark. This intraday reversal underscores a strong recovery pattern, hinting at increasing market momentum and potential continuation of the upward trajectory.\n\nInstitutional activity appears to be reinforcing Stellar’s resilience. Open interest has climbed beyond $300 million, reflecting rising participation from professional traders and funds. As an ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrency, XLM is seen as strategically positioned for upcoming Fedwire and SWIFT upgrades in 2025 — a narrative driving institutional confidence in the network’s role in global payments.\n\nSustained accumulation around $0.38 suggests that large buyers are taking advantage of temporary pullbacks, with surging volumes confirming renewed interest in Stellar’s cross-border payment infrastructure. Consolidation near $0.40 signals the market’s growing conviction that XLM’s recovery could extend further as payment-focused digital assets gain mainstream traction.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$122,749.21\nrebounded from Asian session lows of $111,000 to $112,800, repeating a pattern seen on Tuesday. However, the token remains below its 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), with liquidity analysis and retail crowd sentiment signaling a potential for a deeper pullback. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 0.7% over the past 24 hours, standing at 4,027.\n\nTwo notable developments have emerged. The competition between on-chain decentralized exchanges Hyperliquid and Aster has intensified, with Aster surpassing Hyperliquid in daily revenue. According to DefiLlama, Aster generated $7.2 million in revenue in the past 24 hours compared to Hyperliquid’s $2.79 million. This divergence is also reflected in their native tokens: ASTR’s market cap has soared from $931 million to $3.74 billion in seven days, while HYPE’s market cap has dropped from $14.88 billion to $11.73 billion.\n\nASTR has surged 37% over 24 hours, the best performance among the top 100 tokens by market cap, whereas HYPE ranked among the worst performers. In recent months, Hyperliquid has lost market share to competitors like Aster and Lighter, making this an area investors should watch closely.\n\nMeanwhile, data from CryptoRank shows Solana’s launchpad activity has sharply declined, with combined volume hitting a four-month low of $117 million. Active wallets have fallen below 100,000, and daily token project graduates – projects that have successfully completed their initial fundraising or token sale phases and moved on to public trading – have dropped to just 88, indicating reduced user engagement and fewer new launches.\n\nJeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, challenged the idea of a broad crypto bull market, emphasizing that the 2025 rally is narrow and selective, focused on certain coins backed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital asset trusts (DATs) such as BTC, ETH, and SOL.\n\nIn traditional markets, the U.S. dollar rose 0.4%, likely influenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s cautious remarks on rate cuts earlier in the week. Nasdaq futures showed gains, offering risk-on cues to the crypto market.

    "content": "Bitcoin-focused Latin American company OranjeBTC is set to go public on Brazil’s B3 exchange in early October with more than $400 million in BTC reserves, making it Brazil’s largest publicly-traded bitcoin treasury firm.\n\nThe move, confirmed by local news outlet Brazil Journal and at Mercado Bitcoin’s DAC 2025 conference, will see it go public via a reverse merger with Intergraus, a prep-course provider already listed on the exchange. Once the transaction closes, Oranje will assume Intergraus’ public listing with a roughly 85% free float.\n\nOranje holds 3,650 bitcoin, roughly six times more than Brazilian fintech Méliuz, the only other major publicly-traded bitcoin treasury firm in the country.

    "title": "Crypto Doesn’t Need Safe Havens, It Needs Safe Markets",
    "content": "Crypto has never needed “safe havens.” It needs safe markets.\n\nThe difference is more than semantics. A safe haven is a place to hide; a safe market is a place to build. Jurisdictions that understand this distinction will be the ones that capture the next significant wave of serious capital.\n\nThe crypto industry has been in a regulatory tug-of-war for over a decade. On one side, innovators argued that too much oversight would suffocate the technology, while skeptics warned that too little would expose investors to catastrophic risk. The collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022 only widened this divide even more.\n\nCaught in the middle, many crypto businesses took on a simple playbook: they found the jurisdiction with the lightest touch, grabbed a license and called it a win. This “safe haven” strategy created short-term advantages for many of those companies. It allowed exchanges and token issuers to scale quickly, avoid tough questions and brand themselves as pioneers. Outside of the U.S. — and therefore, outside the reach of Gary Gensler, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and industry boogeyman known for his regulation-by-enforcement approach to crypto — many of those companies likely felt relief. But it also produced exactly what critics feared: markets where investor protection was an afterthought, enforcement was inconsistent and credibility was fragile.\n\nThe result is a trust deficit that still weighs heavily on the industry today.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) has nailed the delicate balance in regulating crypto, carefully walking the line between innovation and safety.\n\nInstead of rushing to become a permissive playground, the country took a slower, more considered approach. It invested in a comprehensive regulatory framework, launching entities like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).\n\nThe UAE’s goal was never to attract companies looking for shortcuts, but to build an ecosystem where safety and supervision are the primary focus. This matters because capital behaves differently today than it did in crypto’s early years. Retail traders may have chased offshore exchanges and high-risk offerings, but institutional investors are motivated by an entirely different calculus.\n\nPension funds, sovereign wealth funds and family offices are gravitating more and more toward markets where strategies have been tried and tested. They allocate capital in jurisdictions where they can trust the rules of the game, where custodians meet international standards and where enforcement is legitimate, that is, where laws and regulations are applied consistently, fairly, and transparently.\n\nBy positioning itself as a safe market rather than a safe haven, the UAE is sending exactly the right signal: innovation is welcome, but accountability is non-negotiable.\n\nThe UAE’s multi-layered regulatory environment gives crypto businesses the choice of which regulatory framework suits their operational needs. This is a reflection of the UAE’s ability to support genuine innovation and healthy competition through transparent frameworks and world-class regulatory standards.\n\nIt’s further evidence that the UAE is evolving beyond minimum compliance, creating an ecosystem where capital, talent and fresh ideas not only converge, but thrive.\n\nThe idea that a weak regulatory framework could be an asset for the crypto industry is losing traction fast. In fact, the opposite is now true. Loophole jurisdictions are becoming liabilities.\n\nGlobal regulators are closing ranks, sharing intelligence, and applying pressure on markets that undercut standards. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which sets the global standard for financial markets regulation has increasingly focused on crypto markets in recent years.\n\nAt the same time, retail investors are more cautious — the high-profile collapses of exchanges and lenders in recent years have reminded everyone that when the rules are unclear or unenforced, it is the investor who pays the price.\n\nMarkets that rely on being “easier” are already getting called out publicly. Malta was recently criticized by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) for not conducting enough due diligence before granting a license to a crypto firm.\n\nMore recently, Malta pushed back on the push for centralized European crypto regulation, with the local securities regulator saying it doesn’t support regulatory centralization.\n\nBeing known as a regulatory arbitrage hub may have worked in 2017, but in 2025, it is a massive red flag.\n\nThe next phase of crypto adoption will be defined less by speculative trading and more by integration into mainstream finance.\n\nThat means stablecoins backed by real reserves, tokenized assets with clear legal protections and exchanges that can withstand the scrutiny of institutional due diligence.\n\nThis is why the safe market model is more powerful than the safe haven model. It aligns with the interests of long-term investors, creates durable trust and ultimately raises the bar for the entire industry.\n\nCrypto is often described as borderless, but capital is not. Money flows along channels of credibility and regulation. The jurisdictions that recognize this will become the winners. They will not be the places where oversight is weakest —they will be the places where oversight is most effective.\n\nSafety is not a barrier to innovation. It is the foundation of growth. The UAE’s example should challenge other markets to rethink their approach, not to chase companies with lax rules, but to attract them with robust frameworks.\n\nCrypto doesn’t need more havens to hide in. It needs markets strong enough to support its ambitions, transparent enough to earn trust and safe enough to scale. That is where the next wave of capital will go.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Asia Morning Briefing: Capital Controls Doom Asia’s Stablecoin Dreams—Except in Hong Kong",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nIn the lead-up to Seoul's Korea Blockchain Week, discussions about a Korean Won stablecoin were among the leading narratives.\n\nThe idea carries political weight, positioning local currencies as digital alternatives to the U.S. dollar. However, despite the enthusiasm, most Asian currencies are hindered by capital controls that render them unsuitable for global circulation. That leaves the Hong Kong dollar as the region’s only truly usable stablecoin base.\n\nIn Korea, a bill to legalize stablecoins is making its way through the country's legislative bodies. Lawmakers are clear that the initiative is not intended to globalize the Won; offshore use is impossible due to Korea's post-1997 rules aimed at preventing capital flight. South America's re-dollarization via USDT is an example of something lawmakers in Korea don't want.\n\nInstead, it's being pitched as a defense of monetary sovereignty against dollar-based tokens. Korea's central bank chief says he's not against Won stablecoins, but has concerns over foreign convertibility.\n\nBut the same restrictions that preserve sovereignty also block international utility. Korea’s won cannot circulate offshore without triggering the same risks of capital flight that scarred the economy in 1997.\n\nWithout carving out a special jurisdiction or sandbox where such a token could flow freely, effectively mimicking Hong Kong’s SAR status, a KRW stablecoin will remain confined to the domestic market.\n\nThe paradox extends to other Asian currencies. Taiwan’s New Taiwan dollar is locked inside its borders. The renminbi is only partially convertible, restricted on the capital account, which is why Beijing relies on the offshore CNH market. In each case, local stablecoin proposals serve a domestic policy agenda, but cannot scale globally.\n\nHong Kong stands apart. Its dollar is fully convertible, supported by a currency board that pegs it to the U.S. dollar (within a trading band) through extensive reserves.\n\nCapital flows are unrestricted, and the HKD is already widely used internationally in bond markets and for cross-border settlements. A tokenized HKD would be the only Asian stablecoin capable of circulating globally, bridging domestic policy needs with international liquidity.\n\nThe irony is that capital controls designed to protect monetary sovereignty ultimately reinforce the dominance of dollar-backed stablecoins. Unless regional governments are willing to liberalize, the HKD remains the only local currency that can plausibly challenge USDT and USDC on a global stage.\n\nBut then, what's the point? With its peg, the HKD is a de-facto U.S. dollar stablecoin already.\n\nBTC: Bitcoin is trading flat at $112k as ETF flows turn negative. Investors pulled $363M from BTC ETFs as the week began, according to data curated by SoSoValue.\n\nETH: ETH is underperforming BTC in the short term as speculative demand softens and risk sentiment weakens, even as long-term drivers like staking and DeFi remain supportive.\n\nGold: Gold is climbing to fresh highs, fueled by expectations of U.S. rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and demand for a safe haven amid macro uncertainty.\n\nNikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell on Wednesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.33% as stocks in the region tracked their U.S. counterparts.\n\nS&P 500: U.S. stock futures held steady Tuesday night after the S&P 500 ended a three-day winning streak and retreated from record highs.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has secured a strategic investment from HSBC, making it the only company in the sector to be backed by four globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs). HSBC joins JPMorgan Chase, Santander and Wells Fargo on Elliptic’s investor roster.\n\nAs part of the deal, Richard May, Group Head of Financial Crime at HSBC’s corporate and institutional banking arm, will take a seat on Elliptic’s board.\n\nElliptic’s technology is used by financial institutions, crypto exchanges and governments to monitor blockchain transactions for signs of financial crime. With HSBC’s investment, Elliptic says it will step up hiring and expand its footprint in financial services.\n\n“For over a decade, we’ve anticipated the enterprise adoption of digital assets and have invested in the robustness, scale and compliance capabilities required by global financial institutions,” said Elliptic CEO Simone Maini. “This is validation of our vision and the market’s growing needs.”\n\nMay said HSBC’s decision reflects the need for greater visibility into digital asset flows as regulation tightens.\n\n“With the rapid evolution of digital assets and currencies, mitigating financial crime risks has never been more important,” he said. “Elliptic’s solution provides HSBC with greater transparency, helping to meet rising regulatory expectations and industry standards.”\n\nMaini, who joined Elliptic more than a decade ago after a career in banking and financial crime compliance, described HSBC’s involvement as the natural next step in a long relationship.\n\n“As is often the case with these sorts of relationships, it usually starts with some kind of commercial exploration,” she told CoinDesk. “When you see a strategic imperative aligning with a high-potential company, it can lead back to the venture investing team inside the bank, and ultimately that’s where we landed.”\n\nShe said May’s appointment to the board will bring a new dimension: “We don’t currently have a financial crime practitioner on our board, it’s mostly investor backgrounds. Rich brings that 360-degree perspective from both banking and government, and I think it’s going to have a massive influence.”\n\nElliptic has been riding a wave of demand from banks exploring stablecoins and tokenized assets. Earlier this year it launched a tool called Issuer Due Diligence to help banks assess wallet risks before holding stablecoin reserves.\n\nMaini said the firm is also pushing ahead with an “AI-driven roadmap,” including a compliance-focused copilot launched this year to shorten onboarding times for banks entering crypto. Another priority is expanding blockchain coverage:\n\n“We don’t ever want to say no to a customer. If they want to screen transactions on a new network, we need to be ready.”\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Tokenization Is Finance’s Next ETF Moment, And Wall Street Isn’t Ready",
    "content": "In 1993, the first exchange traded fund was launched. At the time, most of Wall Street shrugged. Mutual funds dominated, brokers reigned supreme, and the idea that investors would flock to a new wrapper for index exposure seemed far-fetched. Three decades later, ETFs have reshaped the way the world invests. 15,000 ETFs hold more than $17 trillion in assets globally, power countless retirement portfolios, and are at the very core of financial markets. What began as an experiment is now the default.\n\nToday, we are on the cusp of another revolution of likely greater magnitude. Tokenization of real world assets (RWA) on blockchain rails is not a futuristic thought experiment. It is happening right now. The core idea is simple: take traditional financial instruments — bonds, equities, credit portfolios — and represent them digitally on public blockchains. This makes them programmable, portable, and instantly transferable. In other words, it allows investors to move a US Treasury bond as easily as sending an email.\n\nAt Janus Henderson, we didn’t wait on the sidelines. Last year we partnered with infrastructure provider Centrifuge to launch a liquid Treasury fund issued directly onchain. In just a few months it grew to more than $400 million in assets under management, as investors sought solutions to bring traditional investments on-chain. Building on that success, we expanded with our flagship JAAA strategy, which has already scaled to $750 million. This is no longer theory: it is live investor capital flowing through new rails.\n\nOf course, skepticism remains in large swaths of traditional finance where arguments focus on regulation, entrenched legacy systems, or lack of investor comfort. But we heard similar doubts about ETFs even as recently as the last ten years when the trend was already fully apparent. And while the arguments shift, skepticism is the leading response to virtually every breakthrough innovation in finance. The truth is that adoption does not happen linearly by entrenched players changing their ways. It happens slowly, then all at once, as industry stalwarts are disrupted to a point they can no longer ignore. The world changes around us, and what seemed niche becomes normal.\n\nTokenization is different from past attempts to modernize finance, because it is not just a new wrapper or a new distribution mechanism. It is a new foundation. The infrastructure of global capital markets evolves slowly, and has been left behind. Settlements take days when they could take seconds. Costs are embedded in layers of intermediaries. Access is limited via a small club of institutions. Investors and issuers alike are frustrated. Tokenization addresses these frictions directly. By moving assets onchain, investors get instantaneous settlement, radical transparency, and the ability for investment products to be integrated into decentralized finance. In the same way that mobile has led to new business and transformed consumer behavior, blockchain will spawn whole new models of finance.\n\nThe implications go beyond efficiency. Tokenization opens the door to a more inclusive financial system. Imagine a teacher in Jakarta holding the S&P 500 in her digital wallet and using that to secure a loan for a new business idea, or a worker in London sending frictionless, interest-bearing micro payments to a family member in São Paulo. Tokenization allows institutions to serve clients who have historically been locked out of the traditional financial system. It also allows institutions who already utilize these investments to completely modernize the way they engage with their assets. It makes those assets more accessible, portable, and usable in a new era of programmable finance.\n\nBy providing the rails to issue, manage, and distribute tokenized funds, Centrifuge’s technology has enabled us to bring these products to market quickly and securely. The partnership has allowed a 90-year-old, $450 billion AUM global asset manager to operate with the speed, transparency, security, and interoperability that only blockchain can deliver. The result is a proof point for the coming re-platforming of the global financial system.\n\nThe question now is not whether tokenization works. It clearly does. The real question is whether asset managers and regulators will move fast enough to capture the opportunity, or will instead watch as new entrants build a parallel system that better meets the needs of global investors.\n\nThe traditional finance industry cannot wait for permission to innovate. The generational technology revolution for finance is not AI, it is blockchain. The technology is mature, the benefits are undeniable, and the momentum is here now. Traditional financial firms face a choice: embrace tokenization and shape the next chapter of global finance, or watch as the transformation happens without us.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

But gold isn't the only asset partying while bitcoin stagnates under $115,000.\n\nU.S. stocks have also been notching record highs on what seems to be a daily basis, including bellwether S&P 500 index, which is perched just below the 6,700 level.\n\nEven with BTC struggling of late, the world's largest crypto remains in a bull market and this isn't the first time this cycle its performance has diverged from that of the S&P 500.\n\nThe first divergence occurred between March and July of 2024. During this period, the S&P 500 climbed from around 4,000 to 4,600, while bitcoin declined from just under $30,000 to $25,000.\n\nThe second divergence took place later that year when the S&P 500 rallied from 5,200 to 6,000 from April to October. with only a brief summer pause. Bitcoin, however, did not follow, with its rally not beginning until November (alongside the presidential election results).\n\nAs for this most recent divergence, the S&P 500 since May has moved steadily higher, while bitcoin has consolidated within the $110,000 to $120,000 range. Bitcoin did break to new all time highs in August, but those gains were quickly reversed, with BTC returning to the low end of its previous range.\n\nHistory suggests that while bitcoin and the S&P 500 often move in the same general direction, they periodically diverge for extended periods. The data from at least this current cycle suggests that bitcoin is likely to catch up to gold.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "SEC's Atkins Says Agency Pushing Toward 2025 Rules Allowing Crypto Firm Innovation",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is heading toward a year-end goal for its effort to get crypto firms pushing new products under the regulator's oversight, Chairman Paul Atkins said in a Tuesday interview on Fox Business.\n\nThe pro-digital assets rhetoric from Atkins is on-brand for his campaign to roll out friendly policies for the industry, aligned with orders from President Donald Trump. Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said earlier this month that they're inviting existing registered firms to move forward on crypto activity and that they should just check in with any questions about how to proceed, and the SEC also posted a public agenda that reflected planned rules on the offer and sale of crypto securities, including exemptions and safe harbors.\n\n\"We're trying to give the marketplace some kind of stable platform upon which they can introduce new products,\" Atkins said. \"We'll be doing rulemaking in the coming months. We're looking for an innovation exemption to try to get that in place by year end.\"\n\nThough he suggested an end-of-year timeline, any rulemaking process has to pass through multiple stages that generally each takes months of time and requires public input.\n\nJust last week, the agency moved to let exchanges list exchange-traded products (ETPs) holding spot commodities, including cryptocurrencies, without requiring the agency’s individual review each time — a generic listing standard that will reduce barriers for new products. The SEC has also been issuing staff policy statements to act as informal guidance on its crypto views, touching on diverse areas such as memecoins, mining and stablecoins. However, those topics would need formal rules approved by action at the commission level to get firm legal footing.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers in Congress — most specifically the Senate Banking Committee and Agriculture Committee — are working on the latest legislation to set guardrails around the U.S. crypto markets. Advocates of that bill, which is largely similar to the House of Representatives' Digital Asset Market Clarity Act that already passed with a wide bipartisan vote, are reportedly aiming for further committee action in late October.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to congress acting on this,\" Atkins said.While the legislation will clearly define the roles of the SEC and CFTC and the borders between crypto securities, commodities and other assets, Atkins has said since his first days running the agency that it can move forward on policy without Congress.\n\nRead More: U.S. SEC's Atkins Posts Agency's Near-Term Agenda Jammed With Crypto Efforts\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

A prime example of this is Base, the Ethereum overlay blockchain attached to Coinbase which recently partnered with Shopify to offer global USDC payments.\n\n“Our mission at Base is to build a global economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom. To do this, we need more founders to build on-chain businesses so that anyone, anywhere can participate in the global economy,” the blog post said.\n\nThe initiative comes as U.S. lawmakers move to clarify rules for crypto. The GENIUS Act, a new U.S. law governing stablecoins, aims to bring federal clarity by directing regulators to come up with specific rules for stablecoin issuers. U.S. lawmakers continue to work on broader crypto market structure legislation as well.\n\nMore For You\n\nMetaMask Will Add Polymarket Prediction Markets, Rolls Out Perp Trading With Hyperliquid\n\nThe crypto wallet said will allow users to bet on real-world outcomes as part of an exclusive partnership with Polymarket, coming later this year.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Semler Scientific Still Has Nearly 170% Upside After Strive Buyout Deal: Benchmark",
    "content": "Shares of Semler Scientific (SMLR) closed at $32.06, well below the implied $86.30 takeout value in its announced all-stock acquisition by Strive (ASST), a discount Benchmark analyst Mark Palmers say reflects both skepticism and opportunity in the emerging bitcoin treasury M&A wave.\n\nPalmer reiterated its buy rating on Semler while trimming his price target on the stock to $86 from $101 to reflect the terms of the Strive deal.\n\nThe fixed exchange ratio, 21.05 Strive shares per Semler share, suggests a lucrative arbitrage spread for investors, especially with both boards having approved the deal. Palmer said the market may be underestimating the long-term implications of consolidating bitcoin-heavy balance sheets under a single corporate roof.\n\nStrive, which recently disclosed it holds 5,886 bitcoin, would add Semler’s 5,021 BTC for a combined 10,907 tokens, enough to rank twelfth among public companies holding the cryptocurrency, trailing only Strategy, the report noted.\n\nImportantly, the merger gives Strive not only scale in crypto reserves but also ownership of Semler’s diagnostics business, which it intends to monetize or spin off after the deal closes, Palmer said. That cash-flowing asset base may give Strive more flexibility than pure bitcoin treasury plays.\n\nThe transaction marks the first major move in what Benchmark believes will become a broader wave of stock-for-stock bitcoin treasury mergers. By leveraging its own equity, Strive appears to be capturing BTC at favorable prices, using a \"preferred-equity-only leverage model\" that avoids typical maturity and margin risks associated with debt-based strategies.\n\nHowever, risks remain. The deal depends on an effective S-4 registration and Semler shareholder approval. Any sharp decline in Strive or the bitcoin price before the vote could pressure deal terms. \"If Strive’s share price weakens materially into the vote, the implied value to SMLR drops, possibly inviting renegotiation pressure or widening the arb haircut,\" the report added.\n\nSMLR shares are higher by 2.5% premarket to $32.86.

    "title": "HBAR Surges 3.85% in Volatile Session as Institutional Buying Emerges",
    "content": "HBAR saw a volatile 23-hour stretch between Sept. 22 at 15:00 and Sept. 23 at 14:00, with the token trading in a narrow band between $0.217129 and $0.225507. The session opened with a sharp selloff that dragged prices to $0.217408 before heavy buying activity restored momentum.\n\nThat rebound was reinforced by strong support at the $0.217129 level, as trading volume surged. Bulls then pushed prices to a peak just shy of $0.225507, though resistance emerged near $0.224358, capping further upside. By session’s end, HBAR closed at $0.222759, marking a 2.5% recovery from intraday lows and establishing a position above the range midpoint, signaling a bullish bias heading into the next phase of trading.\n\nThe final hour of the session added another layer of optimism. HBAR posted a modest 0.06% gain in the tightly concentrated 60-minute window ending Sept. 23 at 14:08, trading within a constricted 0.40% range between $0.2221 and $0.2230. That narrow band reflected consolidation but also demonstrated underlying strength, as prices remained consistently above session midpoint levels.\n\nDuring this hour, volume spikes highlighted the intensity of market activity. A breakout at 13:27 drove turnover to 881,924 tokens, followed by an exceptional surge to 1.58 million tokens just before 14:00. Those bursts of participation helped reinforce support at $0.2221, while $0.2230 capped immediate upside efforts. Despite the constrained range, sustained demand suggested accumulation rather than exhaustion.\n\nOverall, the late-session performance extended HBAR’s broader 23-hour recovery trend. Bulls maintained control, with firm support levels intact and prices closing near the upper end of the range. The steady bid tone indicates continued bullish momentum heading into the next session, keeping market participants on watch for a potential breakout above short-term resistance.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "The 38th week of the year is historically the third-worst performing week for bitcoin, averaging a return of -2.25%. Only week 28 (-2.78%) and week 14 (-3.91%) have been weaker historically, according to Coinglass data.\n\nThis week, bitcoin is already down nearly 2%, trading around $113,000, with September’s monthly options expiry pointing to a max pain level at $110,000, according to Deribit, this could imply further downside.\n\nMax pain refers to the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts (calls and puts) expire worthless, effectively maximizing losses for option buyers.\n\nIn addition, market enthusiasm has faded. Perpetual funding rates for bitcoin, which measure the ongoing cost of holding leveraged long or short positions in perpetual futures contracts, have dropped to 4%, one of their lowest levels in a month.\n\nA low positive funding rate suggests reduced demand for leveraged long exposure, often signaling that speculative froth in the market has cooled.\n\nWhile, implied volatility (IV), which reflects market expectations for future price swings, is also near historic lows at 37.\n\nDespite the weekly dip, bitcoin remains 4% higher in September and up 6% for the quarter. With roughly 14 weeks left in the year and most of those weeks historically producing positive returns, this may represent calm before potential volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, gold has continued its impressive rally, climbing another 1% on Tuesday and now more than 42% higher year to date, which continues to take the sting out of bitcoin.\n\nAnother factor weighing on bitcoin sentiment is the massive gains in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing stocks, for example IREN (IREN), which may have taken some shine away from bitcoin in the short term.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

In other words, the range play has resolved bearishly, indicating potential for further losses toward the Jun. 22 low of $0.00001004.\n\nThe range breakdown saw a volume surge of 5.29 trillion tokens, indicating an institutional liquidation event, according to CoinDesk's market analytics.\n\nWhile SHIB fell 5%, dogecoin suffered a bigger loss of over 8%, resulting in a notable recovery in the Binance-listed SHIB-DOGE pair from record lows.\n\nThe pair's daily MACD histogram is on track to turn positive, marking a bullish shift in momentum, which suggests that SHIB could continue to outperform DOGE in the coming days.\n\nThat said, the overall outlook would remain bearish as long as the descending trendline from the March 2024 highs remains intact.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Fnality, a fintech firm building tokenized versions of major currencies collateralized by cash held at central banks, has raised $136 million in a Series C round to expand its blockchain-based wholesale payment systems, the London-based firm said Tuesday.\n\nThe investment was led by WisdomTree, Bank of America, Citi, KBC Group, Temasek and Tradeweb, with existing backers including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Barclays also participating.\n\nFnality raised $95 million in 2023, a round led by Goldman and BNP Paribas. The firm's settlement infrastructure runs on distributed ledger technology and allows sterling payments to be processed on-chain with central bank money.\n\nThe new capital will go toward rolling out similar systems in other currencies, enhancing liquidity management tools and supporting settlement of tokenized assets such as securities and stablecoins, according to a press release.\n\nThe firm’s offering enables real-time settlement of trades, delivery-versus-payment for digital securities, and payment-versus-payment for foreign exchange. For banks, that could mean fewer intermediaries, faster settlement and more efficient use of capital. For example, a repo trade that typically takes a day to settle could close instantly, freeing up cash for other transactions.\n\nFnality CEO Michelle Neal said the funding marks a step toward “a hybrid future of global finance,” where traditional institutions interact seamlessly with decentralized markets. Backers such as WisdomTree and Bank of America framed the investment as part of a broader shift to modernize financial infrastructure for tokenized assets.\n\nMore For You\n\nNorth Dakota to Issue Stablecoin With Fiserv as Digital Dollar Trend Expands\n\nThe Fiserv-powered U.S. dollar stablecoin will be available to local banks and credit unions, joining crypto experiments by U.S. states.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Societe Generale-FORGE (SG-FORGE), the cryptocurrency-focused subsidiary of the French bank, has chosen the European arm of crypto exchange Bullish as the first venue to list the lender’s USD CoinVertible (USDCV) stablecoin.\n\nThe dollar-denominated USDCV stablecoin, which SG Forge introduced on Ethereum and Solana back in June of this year, will list on Bullish Europe, the companies said on Tuesday. Bullish Global is also the owner of CoinDesk.\n\nThe arrival of regulations around stablecoins has caught the attention of the financial industry. SG Forge’s USDCV stablecoin, like its euro-denominated counterpart (EURCV), is regulated under the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA).\n\nAlthough the GENIUS Act has been passed by the U.S. Congress, the full regulation is not yet in place, pointed out Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of Societe Generale-FORGE. This means it will be some time before the bank’s stablecoins will be available to U.S. residents.\n\n“For the moment, we have clarity in Europe with MiCA, but we don't have this clarity in the U.S. Being a bank subsidiary, if we don't have a clear picture, we can't go ahead like a crypto player might do,” Stenger said in an interview.\n\n“It's probably several months ahead of us to have all these additional rules which will be issued in the U.S. So for now, we restrict the access of this product to non-U.S. investors, and once we will have a clear picture of the environment in the U.S., our goal is to lift this constraint,” he said.\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk about stablecoins among banks and other traditional finance firms, what with the bedding in of MiCA and U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration. That said, SocGen remains the main stablecoin trailblazer among systemically important banks, for the time being at least.\n\nSG Forge’s EURCV euro stablecoin, which was launched in 2023, has around €40 million ($47m) of turnover every day, according to Stenger. He said the number of exchanges and brokers allowed to directly mint and burn the stablecoin is growing steadily, while there are 10 or 15 exchanges in the queue to be on-boarded.\n\n“We have one single KYC procedure and policy for the group, meaning that we onboard crypto exchanges and brokers the same way SocGen will onboard any other client,” Stenger said. “On occasion it's a big order for some crypto players, but it’s important towards building strong partnerships.”\n\nMore For You\n\nNorth Dakota to Issue Stablecoin With Fiserv as Digital Dollar Trend Expands\n\nThe Fiserv-powered U.S. dollar stablecoin will be available to local banks and credit unions, joining crypto experiments by U.S. states.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "HBAR Experiences Sharp Decline Amid High Volume Selling Pressure",
    "content": "HBAR experienced a sharp downturn over a 23-hour trading window between September 21 and 22, as the token tumbled from $0.24 to $0.22. The 6.29% decline was accompanied by a dramatic expansion in volatility, with trading ranges reaching 9.7%—well above monthly averages. Market pressure intensified as institutional sellers drove prices lower, establishing firm resistance around the $0.235–$0.24 zone and triggering a wave of liquidations.\n\nThe most pronounced selling pressure arrived at midnight on September 22, when volumes surged to 137.11 million, nearly triple the daily baseline. This spike marked the peak of the selloff as market sentiment soured across crypto assets, amplifying HBAR’s decline. At the trough, the token hovered around $0.22, signaling potential capitulation among short-term holders.\n\nYet, the session ended with a notable rebound. In the final hour of trading, bulls regained momentum, pushing HBAR from $0.2197 to $0.2222. A breakout above the $0.22 threshold was fueled by an exceptional 6.21 million in volume within minutes, sparking a short-lived rally toward session highs near $0.2225. The recovery underscored the token’s liquidity-driven dynamics, though volumes collapsed to zero in the final three minutes, suggesting a temporary equilibrium.\n\nHBAR’s volatile session highlights the crypto market’s heightened sensitivity to institutional flows and sentiment-driven reversals. The combination of sharp declines, outsized volume spikes, and a late-stage rebound illustrates the rapid shifts in liquidity that define digital asset markets—underscoring how quickly bearish pressure can give way to opportunistic buying.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "Here Are the 3 Make-Or-Break Bitcoin Price Floors as BTC Sell-Off Gathers Steam",
    "content": "As bitcoin’s [BTC] recent sell-off accelerates, analysts are focusing on three critical price support levels that could shape the cryptocurrency’s near-term trajectory.\n\nThe first key level is $112,000, identified by Swissblock Technologies. “As long as $112,000 holds and the Risk stays stable, BTC can rebuild strength,” Swissblock noted on X.\n\nThe firm’s proprietary Bitcoin Risk Index aggregates on-chain valuation and cost-basis data to gauge market volatility—rising readings indicate risk aversion and potential price swings, while low or stable levels suggest bullish sentiment.\n\nOn Monday, the risk index hovered near zero, signaling optimism despite BTC’s 1.7% drop to $112,600 in the past 24 hours, with prices briefly dipping as low as $111,717, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nSwissblock also highlighted $110,000 as a “lifeline support.” Historical charts reveal that in the December-January period, buyers struggled to hold BTC above this level, marking it as a significant zone to monitor.\n\nThe third crucial support is the on-chain metric known as the “short-term holder cost basis,” currently at $111,400.\n\nAnalytics firm Glassnode defines this as the average purchase price for wallets that have acquired bitcoin within the last 155 days. This indicator is widely regarded as a battleground between bulls and bears—prices above it generally reflect bullish conviction. In contrast, sustained trading below it could signal increased risk of sell-offs or a shift toward a bearish market structure.\n\n“Sustained trading below this level could signal a shift toward a mid- to long-term bearish market structure,” Glassnode explained on X.\n\nTogether, these three levels – $110,000, $111,400, and $112,000 – form a delicate support zone that traders are closely watching as bitcoin navigates this volatile phase.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The U.S. and U.K. have established a joint Transatlantic Taskforce aimed at strengthening cooperation on capital markets and digital assets.\n\nThe task force, announced on Sep. 22 by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, will bring together officials from HM Treasury, the U.S. Treasury and market regulators across both jurisdictions.\n\nTwo of the goals of the task force is to develop approaches to digital asset oversight and explore new opportunities in wholesale digital markets.\n\nThe group will report within 180 days through the existing U.K.–U.S. Financial Regulatory Working Group, delivering recommendations shaped in close consultation with private industry, the release said.\n\n“London and New York remain the twin pillars of global finance,” Reeves said, adding that closer alignment is essential as technology reshapes markets. Bessent echoed that sentiment during a Downing Street roundtable, calling the initiative a commitment to ensuring innovation in financial markets “does not stop at borders.”\n\nWhile the task force’s remit spans traditional capital markets, digital assets are expected to take center stage.\n\nOfficials will look at both short-term measures, such as facilitating cross-border use cases while legislation remains in flux, and long-term strategies for advancing wholesale digital market infrastructure.\n\n“With the creation of a joint U.K.-U.S. task force on capital markets and digital assets, we can expect meaningful developments on both sides of the Atlantic,” Mark Aruliah, head of EMEA policy and regulatory affairs at Elliptic, said in an email.\n\nWhile noting that the U.S. has “set the pace with a pro-innovation agenda,” Aruliah suggested the task force “signals a strong intent to close that gap and position the U.K. more competitively.”\n\nMore broadly, the firm described the collaboration as a validation of the digital assets industry itself: “Structured collaboration of this kind will strengthen a shared commitment to higher standards of transparency and accountability, and may establish a global benchmark if other jurisdictions follow suit.”\n\nMore For You\n\nNorth Dakota to Issue Stablecoin With Fiserv as Digital Dollar Trend Expands\n\nThe Fiserv-powered U.S. dollar stablecoin will be available to local banks and credit unions, joining crypto experiments by U.S. states.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Hyperliquid, once the uncontested leader in the on-chain perpetuals market, is fast ceding ground to emerging platforms such as Lighter and Aster.\n\nAt one point in May, Hyperliquid accounted for 71% of the on-chain crypto perpetuals market. That number now stands at 38%, according to pseudonymous Dune Analytics user @uwusanauwu.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors such as a16z-backed Lighter and Binance Labs-backed Aster have increased their market share to 16.8% and 14.9%, respectively, from lower single digits in May. These percentages are based on weekly trading volumes and exclude wash trading figures.\n\nThe on-chain perpetuals market refers to the decentralized trading of perpetual futures contracts (with no expiration) that occurs directly on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.\n\nPerpetuals are derivatives without an expiration date, allowing traders to speculate on the price movements of the underlying assets. These contracts employ a unique funding rate mechanism to maintain perpetual prices in alignment with the spot price of the underlying asset.\n\nThe on-chain perpetual market has experienced rapid growth. All platforms combined have registered a cumulative trading volume of nearly $700 billion over the past four weeks, with activity reaching $42 billion in the last 24 hours alone.\n\nThe number of protocols has grown significantly from just two in 2022 to over 80 as of today. This expansion perfectly exemplifies capitalism at work: a thriving market attracts a flood of new entrants, increasing competition and eroding the market share and profitability of early pioneers.\n\nThe absence of traditional barriers to entry or exit, a key feature of the crypto market, allows anyone with the technical know-how to launch new protocols and compete.\n\nLately, a war of sorts has been unfolding between Hyperliquid and Aster. Last week, Hyperliquid listed Aster's native token ASTR, allowing users to long or short the token with 3x leverage. On Monday, Aster responded by offering Hyperliquid's HYPE perpetuals with 300x leverage.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

China’s U.S. Treasury holdings fell $57 billion in 2024, and momentum for crypto regulation is building in major markets.\n\nDeutsche Bank argues that bitcoin and gold will continue to coexist as complementary hedges against inflation and geopolitical risk, thanks to their scarcity and low correlation to other assets.\n\nGold hit a record high of $3,763 on Monday. The precious metal has risen over 40% year-to-date.\n\nCrucially, bitcoin’s volatility, long an obstacle to reserve status, is dropping, the bank's analysts said. Its 30-day volatility hit historic lows in August, even as prices broke records above $123,500, suggesting the cryptocurrency may be decoupling from its speculative past.\n\nThe bank said neither bitcoin nor gold is likely to dethrone the dollar, as governments will act to protect monetary sovereignty.\n\nDeutsche Bank sees bitcoin’s adoption following a path similar to gold’s, moving from skepticism to widespread acceptance, with regulation, macroeconomic trends and time paving the way.\n\nAs investors continue seeking alternatives to traditional assets, bitcoin could evolve from a speculative bet into a legitimate pillar of the global financial system, the report said.\n\nRead more: Gold Rallies an Hour After Bitcoin Drops, Suggesting a Profit Rotation Into Metals\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "With valuations of crypto treasury companies headed very quickly south in recent weeks, sector consolidation seemed a certainty at some point, with the only question being when it would start.\n\nIt has.\n\nStrive (ASST) has agreed to buy Semler Scientific (SMLR) in an all-stock deal that represents a 210% premium, or $90.52 per share, based on Friday's market close, according to a press release. Each share of SMLR will be exchange of 21.05 shares of ASST.\n\nSemler Executive Chairman Eric Semler is expected to join the board of the combined company.\n\nAlongside, Strive announced the purchase of 5,816 bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,234.31\nfor $675 million, or an average price of $116,047 each.\n\nAdding that to Semler's roughly 5,000 in bitcoin holdings, the combined company would hold more than 10,900 BTC.\n\nThe deal comes as Semler Scientific shares have been under relentless pressure for several weeks, trading for well below the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet, thus presumably giving negative value to its medical equipment business. The popping of the crypto treasury bubble this summer has left a number of companies in similar positions.\n\n\"This merger cements Strive’s position as a top Bitcoin treasury company,\" said Matt Cole, chairman and CEO of Strive. \"We believe our alpha-seeking strategies and capital structure position us to outperform bitcoin over the long run.\"\n\nASST shares are higher by 9.3% premarket to $4.71.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nOver the past 24 hours, the crypto market has experienced notable weakness, consistent with the bearish post-Fed pricing in options and resilience in the dollar index.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,181.02\nfell 2.6% to $112,700, while ether\nETH\n$4,494.20\nslid more than 6%, CoinDesk data show. Broad market sentiment, seen in the CoinDesk 20 Index, dropped nearly 8% and the CoinDesk 80 Index lost 7.5%, underscoring widespread weakness.\n\nU.S. crypto equities also showed pressure in pre-market trading. Bitcoin investor Strategy (MSTR) and digital asset exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) both lost 2.8% while futures tracking the benchmark S&P 500 dipped just 0.2%.\n\nSome analysts framed the pullback as a healthy correction that helps clear excessive leverage from the market and sets the stage for a more sustained advance. The slide has triggered the liquidation of roughly $1.5 billion worth of leveraged crypto positions.\n\nOthers remain more cautious.\n\n\"Total inflows are not strong enough to push bitcoin materially higher,\" Markus Thielen, the founder of 10x Research, noted in a client note.\n\nYear-to-date, crypto markets have attracted around $140.5 billion in inflows: $63.1 billion from stablecoins, $52.4 billion into bitcoin via ETFs, futures, and MicroStrategy (MSTR), and $24.9 billion through ether, Thielen said.\n\nThe recent ETF flows indicate a renewed preference for bitcoin over ether. This month alone, U.S.-listed bitcoin ETFs have raised over $3.48 billion, while ether ETFs have garnered just $406.87 million, according to SoSoValue data.\n\nMatrixport also observed that demand from digital asset treasuries — led recently by Ethereum-focused companies — may be waning.\n\n\"In recent months, the primary buyers have been Ethereum treasury companies, but with net asset values shrinking, their capacity to deploy additional capital may be limited. From a technical standpoint, tighter risk management looks prudent,\" the firm said.\n\nMeanwhile, Arthur Hayes' family office fund, Maelstrom, pointed to an upcoming supply test for the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid's HYPE token. Some 237.8 million HYPE tokens are scheduled to be unlocked over roughly 24 months, representing an average monthly supply increase of nearly $500 million.\n\nHayes reportedly sold 96,600 HYPE, worth $5.1 million, early Monday. The token's price fell to nearly $46, extending a three-day losing streak.\n\nIn traditional markets, gold extended its rally, driven by fiscal concerns that boosted demand for haven assets. The yen traded little changed against the dollar following comments from Yoshimasa Hayashi — one of five candidates to replace Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba — who attributed the weak yen to inflationary pressures.

    "title": "BitMEX Co-founder Arthur Hayes Dumps HYPE for a Ferrari, Then Tells Followers Not to Worry",
    "content": "Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder who now runs crypto venture fund Maelstrom, sold his personal stash of Hyperliquid’s HYPE tokens just weeks after predicting the asset could rally 126-fold.\n\nBlockchain analytics service Lookonchain reported on Sunday that Hayes unloaded 96,628 HYPE — worth about $5.1 million — booking a profit of roughly $823,000, or 19%, in a month.\n\nNot long after, Hayes confirmed the move with his trademark irreverence, posting on X: “Need to pay my deposit on the new Rari 849 Testarossa.” The comment fueled backlash from traders who accused him of pumping HYPE in August before quickly exiting.\n\nHayes pushed back on Monday, insisting the sale was tied to concerns laid out by his firm. “This is why we dumped $HYPE today. But don’t worry 126x is still possible 2028 is a long way off,” he wrote.\n\nEarlier today, Maelstrom published a lengthy X post outlining what it called HYPE’s “first true test.”\n\nStarting Nov. 29, 237.8 million HYPE will begin vesting linearly over two years — unlocking nearly $500 million of tokens per month. At current prices of around $50, that represents $11.9 billion of supply entering circulation.\n\nThe post estimated Hyperliquid’s buyback program could only absorb about 17% of that flow, leaving a potential $410 million monthly overhang. “Has the market priced in the sheer scale of these unlocks?” Maelstrom asked.\n\nMaelstrom framed the looming supply shock as natural for a fast-growing protocol but warned that large vested allocations may tempt early developers and insiders to sell. The firm also noted that even large decentralized autonomous treasury (DAT) deals, such as Sonnet’s $583 million HYPE raise, won’t offset the scale of the unlocks.\n\nThe remarks contrasted sharply with Hayes’s Aug. 27 blog post, where he called Hyperliquid a “decentralized Binance” and argued HYPE could climb 126x by 2028. That thesis relied on bold assumptions: a $10 trillion stablecoin market, Hyperliquid capturing a Binance-level trading share, and fee structures holding steady.\n\nDespite selling his tokens, Hayes reiterated that long-term view on Monday, describing the upcoming unlock as a hurdle, not a death blow. In his words, “2028 is a long way off.”\n\nHyperliquid has surged to become a dominant player in decentralized perpetual futures, and its HYPE token remains central to governance, staking and fee distribution. Whether the market can digest nearly $12 billion in new supply may determine if Hayes’s forecast proves prescient — or overly ambitious.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The timing suggests the possibility that profits from bitcoin liquidations rotated into gold.\n\nThe two assets rarely move in tandem, though there are occasional periods when both rise or fall simultaneously, often with a short lag. This time, the divergence is stronger.\n\nGold is not the only metal attracting flows. Silver gained 1.5% on Monday to approach $44, its third-highest level since 1975, and is now up more than 50% year to date.\n\nNotably, since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 bps on Sept. 17, both gold and the S&P 500 are up about 1%. At the same time, U.S. treasury yields have risen, with the U.S. 10-year at 4.125% (up 2.5%) and the U.S. 30-year at 4.7% (up 2%).\n\nThe dollar strengthened, with the DXY index adding 1% to 97.5.

It was recently 6% lower over 24 hours. Bitcoin, the largest token, declined almost 3% to $111,998 before recovering slightly.\n\nDOGE\n$0.2577\nslumped more than 10% to lead losses among major tokens, with Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA, BNB Chain's BNB and Tron's TRX showing losses of at least 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nMore than 407,000 traders were liquidated over a 24-hour period, Coinglass data show, the highest such losses in recent months. Liquidations occur when leveraged positions are forcibly closed due to a price move beyond a trader’s margin threshold. This typically results in major losses and can trigger cascade effects during volatile moves.\n\nTraders use liquidation data to gauge market sentiment and positioning. Large long liquidations often signal panic bottoms, while short liquidations may precede a squeeze.\n\nSpikes in liquidations also help identify overcrowded trades and potential reversals. When paired with open interest and funding rate data, liquidation metrics can offer strategic entry or exit points, especially in overleveraged markets prone to sudden flushes or rallies.\n\nThe wave of liquidations comes against a macro backdrop that remains highly uncertain despite the Federal Reserve’s latest interest-rate cut.\n\n“The market’s trajectory hinges critically on upcoming economic data and Fed signals,” said Nassar Achkar, chief strategy officer at CoinW. “This macro uncertainty is likely to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially capping the upside for Ethereum and the broader DeFi sector despite their superior yield opportunities.”\n\nInvestors are watching U.S. PMI data and jobless claims later this week, Achkar noted, while Powell’s Tuesday speech is expected to steer risk appetite.

    "title": "Fed’s Sept. 17 Rate Cut Could Spark Short-Term Jitters but Supercharge Bitcoin, Gold and Stocks Long Term",
    "content": "Investors are counting down to the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17 monetary policy decision; markets expect a quarter-point rate cut that could trigger short-term volatility but potentially fuel longer-term gains across risk assets.\n\nThe economic backdrop highlights the Fed’s delicate balancing act.\n\nAccording to the latest CPI report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday, consumer prices rose 0.4% in August, lifting the annual CPI rate to 2.9% from 2.7% in July, as shelter, food, and gasoline pushed costs higher. Core CPI also climbed 0.3%, extending its steady pace of recent months.\n\nProducer prices told a similar story: per the latest PPI report released on Wednesday, the headline PPI index slipped 0.1% in August but remained 2.6% higher than a year earlier, while core PPI advanced 2.8%, the largest yearly increase since March. Together, the reports underscore stubborn inflationary pressure even as growth slows.\n\nThe labor market has softened further.\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased by just 22,000 in August, with federal government and energy sector job losses offsetting modest gains in health care. Unemployment held at 4.3%, while labor force participation remained stuck at 62.3%.\n\nRevisions showed June and July job growth was weaker than initially reported, reinforcing signs of cooling momentum. Average hourly earnings still rose 3.7% year over year, keeping wage pressures alive.\n\nBond markets have adjusted accordingly. Per data from MarketWatch, 2-year Treasury yield sits at 3.56%, while the 10-year is at 4.07%, leaving the curve modestly inverted. Futures traders see a 93% chance of a 25 basis point cut, according to CME FedWatch.\n\nIf the Fed limits its move to just 25 bps, investors may react with a “buy the rumor, sell the news” response, since markets have already priced in relief.\n\nEquities are testing record levels.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed Friday at 6,584 after rising 1.6% for the week, its best since early August. The index’s one-month chart shows a strong rebound from its late-August pullback, underscoring bullish sentiment heading into Fed week.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite also notched five straight record highs, ending at 22,141, powered by gains in megacap tech stocks, while the Dow slipped below 46,000 but still booked a weekly advance.\n\nCrypto and commodities have rallied alongside.\n\nBitcoin is trading at $115,234, below its Aug. 14 all-time high near $124,000 but still firmly higher in 2025, with the global crypto market cap now $4.14 trillion.\n\nGold has surged to $3,643 per ounce, near record highs, with its one-month chart showing a steady upward trajectory as investors price in lower real yields and seek inflation hedges.\n\nHistorical precedent supports the cautious optimism.\n\nAnalysis from the Kobeissi Letter — reported in an X thread posted Saturday — citing Carson Research, shows that in 20 of 20 prior cases since 1980 where the Fed cut rates within 2% of S&P 500 all-time highs, the index was higher one year later, averaging gains of nearly 14%.\n\nThe shorter term is less predictable: in 11 of those 22 instances, stocks fell in the month following the cut. Kobeissi argues this time could follow a similar pattern — initial turbulence followed by longer-term gains as rate relief amplifies the momentum behind assets like equities, bitcoin and gold.\n\nThe broader setup explains why traders are watching the Sept. 17 announcement closely.\n\nCutting rates while inflation edges higher and stocks hover at records risks denting credibility, yet staying on hold could spook markets that have already priced in easing. Either way, the Fed’s message on growth, inflation, and its policy outlook will likely shape the trajectory of markets for months to come.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Stablecoins: The Revolution in Global Money Transfers",
    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nEvery day, billions of dollars move across blockchains through stablecoins. The market is dominated by USDT ($175B market cap) and USDC ($75B), but a growing ecosystem of new entrants is expanding the landscape. Stablecoins are no longer a crypto sideshow — they’re becoming one of the largest financial innovations since the rise of electronic payments.\n\nTheir use cases are broad, but four stand out:\n\nOf these, the cross-border and remittance use case has the biggest growth potential. USD-denominated stablecoins are quietly replacing SWIFT for small and mid-sized flows — allowing money to move across the world in seconds, not days.\n\nWhat’s being disrupted is not SWIFT in general, but SWIFT as the global rail for dollar transfers. For decades, the U.S. dollar has been the unit of account for global commerce, and SWIFT has been the messaging system coordinating those flows. Now, instead of SWIFT as the intermediary, USD stablecoins themselves serve as the transmission rail: programmable, verifiable and available 24/7.\n\nStablecoins aren’t yet replacing SWIFT at scale — they still account for less than 1% of global money flows — but in remittances, B2B payments and e-commerce, USD stablecoins are already becoming the faster, cheaper complement to the dollar’s traditional wiring system.\n\nWhile USD stablecoins move instantly in the digital world, the real economy still runs on local fiat. That forces liquidity providers to bridge two different states of money:\n\nToday, this mismatch creates friction. Liquidity providers end up holding pesos, reals or naira overnight, unable to recycle capital until banks reopen. The fintech or end-user benefits from instant settlement — but the provider absorbs the cost of locked balances. In effect, stablecoin adoption is capped by the size of provider balance sheets.\n\nFX-on-chain protocols collapse the two-state problem into a single state: digital. Instead of moving between stablecoins and fiat through banks, FX-on-chain enables direct swaps between USD stablecoins and local-currency stablecoins.\n\nThis unlocks two key advantages:\n\nBy unifying flows digitally, liquidity providers are no longer stuck warehousing risk. Instead, capital circulates continuously on-chain — just as it does in global FX markets, but with instant settlement, lower costs and transparent liquidity.\n\nStablecoins are no longer just a bridge between crypto and fiat — they are becoming the rails of global commerce. From households in Argentina hedging inflation, to exporters in Nigeria settling invoices, to institutions arbitraging spreads, stablecoins are embedding themselves everywhere.\n\nThe future hinges on three fronts:\n\nIf the past decade was about bitcoin as “digital gold,” the next will be about stablecoins as “digital fiat” — currently only digital dollars and ultimately, digital fiat for everyone, everywhere.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nThe State of DeFi Exploit Risk\n\nDeFi protocols can rival or surpass traditional financial security standards and introduce frameworks to better assess risks in real-world asset applications for smarter capital allocation, says Cicada Partners Co-Founder Christian Lantzsch.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.

    "title": "The State of DeFi Exploit Risk",
    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nThe decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has undergone a remarkable security transformation, achieving a 90% reduction in exploit losses since 2020 and positioning itself as mature financial infrastructure capable of institutional adoption. Our analysis reveals that DeFi protocols have not only survived the “experimental era” but have systematically evolved into some of the most secure financial systems in existence, with daily loss rates plummeting to just 0.0014% by 2024.\n\nThis evolution represents more than statistical improvement; it demonstrates that decentralized financial systems can achieve and maintain institutional grade security when comprehensive risk frameworks are implemented. The journey from 30.07% annualized losses in 2020 to 0.47% in 2024 marks the transition from experimental protocols to mature financial infrastructure capable of serving institutional scale capital deployment.\n\nFive distinct security phases have defined DeFi’s maturation: The \"Experimental Era\" of 2020 saw devastating 30.07% annualized losses due to unaudited smart contracts and fundamental vulnerabilities. The \"First Security Revolution\" of 2021 delivered an unprecedented 96% improvement through widespread adoption of professional auditing, bug bounty programs and formal verification. After a brief optimization plateau in 2022 and concerning backslide in 2023, the \"Comprehensive Security Achievement\" of 2024 established new standards with 74% loss reduction despite increased protocol complexity.\n\nAttack patterns have fundamentally shifted, revealing both progress and evolving challenges. Yield aggregators, which dominated early DeFi hacks at 49% in 2020, have declined to just 14% by 2024 as protocols matured. Conversely, trading and automated market maker (AMM) platforms emerged as primary targets, growing from 0% to 18% of attacks as attackers focus on high-value, high-liquidity protocols. Most significantly, private key compromises have become the fastest-growing attack vector, jumping from 0% to 20% of incidents, highlighting that as technical security improves, attackers increasingly target operational security weaknesses.\n\nThe lending sector exemplifies this transformation most dramatically, achieving an extraordinary 98.4% improvement in security from 2020 baseline levels. DeFi lending protocols now maintain daily loss rates of just 0.00128%, making them 62.5 times more secure than during the experimental period. This improvement encompasses comprehensive protection against smart contract vulnerabilities, flash loan attacks, pricing manipulation, oracle failures and governance exploits.\n\nWhy this matters: The security achievements documented in this analysis fundamentally challenge prevailing narratives about DeFi risk and demonstrate that decentralized protocols can match or exceed traditional financial system security standards. The introduction of the Structural Risk Factor (SRF) framework provides a methodology for accurately assessing protocol risks in real-world asset (RWA) applications, enabling more informed capital allocation decisions. As institutional adoption accelerates and regulatory frameworks crystallize, these security improvements position DeFi as legitimate financial infrastructure rather than experimental technology, with profound implications for the future of stablecoins and global finance.\n\nThe data reveals that DeFi has successfully transitioned from high-risk experimental protocols to secure financial infrastructure, with comprehensive defense systems now addressing multiple attack vectors simultaneously rather than defending against individual threats in isolation. This transformation establishes the foundation for complex decentralized financial products and institutional-scale capital deployment, proving that community-driven security innovation can achieve results that rival centralized alternatives.\n\nMore For You\n\nStablecoins: The Revolution in Global Money Transfers\n\nStablecoins are no longer just a bridge between crypto and fiat — they are becoming the rails of global commerce, writes Nonco CEO Fernando Martinez.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.

    "title": "Stablecoin Adoption Set to Surge After GENIUS Act, Hit $4T in Cross-Border Volume: EY Survey",
    "content": "Stablecoin adoption is gaining momentum among corporates and financial institutions driven by regulatory clarity and cost-savings in global money transfers, according to a survey by EY-Parthenon.\n\nConducted with 350 executives in June after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, the survey found that 13% of firms already use stablecoins, mainly for cross-border payments. Among those who didn't use stablecoins, 54% expected to adopt them within the next six to 12 months.\n\nRegulatory clarity provided by the GENIUS Act was widely viewed as a turning point. The legislation, which was signed into law in July, provided long-awaited rules for U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, including reserve requirements and issuer approval processes.\n\nExecutives said in the survey the law reduces uncertainty around liquidity, tax treatment and custodial services.\n\nCost savings are also a key driver for adoption, with 41% of current users reporting at least a 10% reduction in expenses from using stablecoins in international transactions.\n\nRespondents also saw stablecoins as a long-term fixture in global finance. By 2030, they estimate stablecoins could facilitate between 5% and 10% of all cross-border payments, representing $2.1 trillion to $4.2 trillion in value.\n\nStill, infrastructure hurdles remain. Only 8% of businesses accepted payments in stablecoins, and many firms planned to lean on banking and fintech partners for integration.\n\nRead more: U.S. Stablecoin Battle Could Be Zero-Sum Game: JPMorgan\n\nMore For You\n\nNorth Dakota to Issue Stablecoin With Fiserv as Digital Dollar Trend Expands\n\nThe Fiserv-powered U.S. dollar stablecoin will be available to local banks and credit unions, joining crypto experiments by U.S. states.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Gold has been one of the strongest performing assets in 2025, rising 38% year to date, outpacing bitcoin23% advance. It's no secret, though, that bitcoin has done wildly better than gold (and pretty much everything else) over its short lifespan.\n\nA check of the two popular inflation-resistant assets against a broad measure of U.S. money supply (known as M2) yields further insight about their performances.\n\nAdjusted for M2 growth, gold — despite its recent strong run — remains below its 2011 peak and roughly the same level as it was in 1975. The all-time high for gold against M2 occurred in 1980.\n\nBitcoin tells a different story. Each bull cycle has seen BTC hit a record versus M2, including last month when bitcoin touched both an absolute all-time high as well as a new high relative to money supply.\n\nThis contrast could highlight the different roles of the two assets. Gold continues to serve as a long-standing hedge and a stabilizer in portfolios, while bitcoin’s behavior shows how new forms of money can respond differently to an era of rapid monetary expansion.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bullish bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,874.42\nbets on Bitfinex, one of the longest-running crypto exchanges, have notably increased in recent weeks, presenting bearish dues for BTC’s price which has fallen below critical moving average support.\n\nData from TradingView shows that BTC/USD long positions on Bitfinex have surged by 20% over the past three months, reaching 52,774 margin trading positions. These longs represent positions using borrowed funds to purchase bitcoin, amplifying both potential gains and risks.\n\nTypically, a rise in long positions implies strong buying pressure and a bullish market sentiment. However, bitcoin’s market has historically shown a paradox where increases in leveraged long positions often precede price declines. This phenomenon is attributed to traders’ tendency to misjudge market trends, leading to forced liquidations or discretionary selling that push prices in the opposite direction.\n\nHistorical analysis reveals that BTC/USD longs on Bitfinex frequently move inversely to bitcoin’s price action. For instance, past rallies in BTC have coincided with declines in Bitfinex longs, while price drops have come alongside rising longs. This contradictory pattern marks these long positions as a contrary indicator rather than a straightforward bullish signal.\n\nThe current surge in longs, therefore, raises bearish caution. At press time, bitcoin’s price briefly slipped below its 100-day simple moving average of $113,283, a key technical level whose breach often signals potential further downside momentum.\n\nThis dynamic underscores a complex interplay: while leveraged longs indicate optimism, they also set up painful liquidations if the market reverses, which could intensify volatility and price declines.\n\nRead more:\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Coinbase CEO: 'We Want to Become a Super App and Provide All Types of Financial Services'",
    "content": "Brian Armstrong, a co-founder and the CEO of Coinbase (COIN), said in an interview on Friday that Coinbase’s long-term goal is to be a financial “super app,” offering crypto alongside a broad range of financial services beyond traditional banking.\n\nArmstrong, speaking on Fox Business’ \"The Claman Countdown,\" told Liz Claman that momentum in Congress is the strongest he has seen, with lawmakers from both parties advancing frameworks for the industry. A move that boosts Coinbase's momentum towards building the super app.\n\nHe explained how his company wants to approach the buildout during the interview.\n\nCoinbase intends to integrate services people typically get from banks and fintechs and deliver them on crypto rails. He pointed to a recently launched Coinbase credit card that pays 4% back in bitcoin as an early example and argued card networks’ 2%–3% swipe fees show why payments need an overhaul.\n\nThe longer-term target, he said, is a comprehensive application that handles spending, savings, payments and investing, not just trading.\n\nArmstrong spelled out the ambition explicitly: “We want to be a bank replacement for people, we want to be their primary financial account,” adding that Coinbase aims to “provide all types of financial services,” not only crypto. He agreed with the framing that this amounts to becoming a super app and said crypto rails make that feasible by offering faster, cheaper settlement.\n\nAccording to Armstrong, the path to the super app starts with lawmakers.\n\nHe pointed to the recent passage of the “Genius Act,” which established rules for stablecoins, and a separate market-structure bill now under debate in the Senate that would define how tokens like bitcoin and ether are regulated.\n\n“This freight train has left the station,” Armstrong said, describing growing bipartisan interest in putting clear rules on the books. He argued that clarity could resolve years of conflict with regulators under the previous administration, who often treated crypto tokens as unregistered securities.\n\nHowever, despite lawmakers' historical push to help set a regulatory framework, one last hurdle needs to be cleared: The lobbying by big banks.\n\nSome institutions, he explained, have sought to restrict rewards programs on stablecoins, claiming they would undermine the traditional payments business. Armstrong dismissed those concerns, saying crypto rewards are no different from airline miles or credit card points.\n\n“American consumers want to earn more money on their money — that should be totally allowed,” he said.\n\nWhile he criticized lobbying efforts to block competition, Armstrong also stressed that Coinbase partners with major banks such as JPMorgan and PNC to provide custody and payments services, showing parts of the sector are embracing crypto rails.\n\nWhile building a super app is a monumental task that has gained momentum, Coinbase still needs to look out for rivals who might be fighting for market share.\n\nHowever, Armstrong isn't worried; rather, he welcomes the competition.\n\nWith new exchanges entering the U.S. market, including platforms launched by Gemini and others, Armstrong said Coinbase benefits from its head start. He argued that a thriving ecosystem is essential for mainstream adoption, and Coinbase’s advantage comes from trust.\n\nAccording to Armstrong, Coinbase now stores more crypto than any other provider, which encourages customers to use its broader suite of services from trading to payments. He said the ambition is not just to facilitate transactions but to eventually become the platform people use as their “primary financial account.”\n\nArmstrong’s “primary account” vision echoes remarks from Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, who asked at the All-In Summit 2025, “Can we be your comprehensive financial platform?” and outlined banking and wealth features as steps toward that goal, according to a report by Business Insider published on Sept. 15. The comparison suggests multiple U.S. fintechs are angling to expand beyond trading into everyday finance.\n\nThe interview also touched on the broader market.\n\nArmstrong avoided short-term predictions but said he sees “a good chance” that bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030.\n\nHe cited three major tailwinds: regulatory clarity, the creation of a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve, and heavy inflows into the newly launched bitcoin ETFs, 80% of which rely on Coinbase for custody.\n\nHe likened bitcoin’s role in portfolios to a hybrid of gold and equities, noting that many investors now view it as both a hedge against uncertainty and a long-term growth asset.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Trump's Relentless Attacks on Fed May Deepen Policy Lag, Send USD Lower",
    "content": "One of the most controversial features of President Donald Trump’s second term is his relentless criticism of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining elevated interest rates – a stance Trump argues is unnecessarily costly to the American economy.\n\nBut this is more than just rhetoric. Trump is aggressively attempting to undermine the Fed’s board, threatening an institution long known for its political independence. Ironically, this very assault risks backfiring, deepening what Trump and others describe as a Fed that is \"behind the curve,\" potentially leading to a deeper sell-off in the U.S. dollar.\n\n\"Political pressures make it tough to credibly shift to an overtly dovish footing. That leaves policy data driven (thus late) rather than pre-emptive. That's bad for the USD,\" the market insights team at Lloyds Bank led by Nicholas Kennedy, said in a note to clients on Sept. 18.\n\nLast Thursday marked a new chapter in Trump’s campaign against the central bank, as his administration took the unprecedented step of petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This would be the first forced removal of a sitting Fed governor since the institution’s founding in 1913.\n\nThe move followed a temporary judicial block issued by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who prevented the ousting of Cook, a Biden appointee, pending further legal proceedings.\n\nAccording to the Lloyds Bank market insights team, such attacks are likely to increase as Powell enters the final months of his term as Chairman. Trump's recent appointee at the Fed, Stephen Miran, is already calling for rapid-fire rate cuts and wants the bank to reduce the benchmark borrowing cost by 50 basis points in the recently concluded meeting.\n\nAt its core, Trump’s campaign reflects a desire for a Fed more responsive to his economic worldview, which demands ultra-low rates around 1%, down significantly from the present 4%.\n\nTrump has argued that current rates keep mortgage costs prohibitively high for many Americans, hindering homeownership and imposing billions in unnecessary debt refinancing expenses. He frames this as a staggering missed opportunity on an otherwise “phenomenal” economy. Meanwhile, many economists agree that rates remain too high given signs of weakening labor markets and consumer health.\n\nThus, the Federal Reserve is widely perceived as “behind the curve” – a technical term meaning it is too slow to cut rates in response to evolving economic conditions.\n\nYet, Trump’s insistence on forcing faster rate cuts risks pushing the Fed further behind this curve.\n\nImagine holding the reins of the world’s most powerful central bank, responsible not only for the world's largest economy, but the fate of the global reserve currency, the USD. Now imagine the political pressure to cut rates quickly, against the fear of appearing politically compromised. This leaves policymakers damned if they act and damned if they don’t.\n\nSo, unlike typical policymakers who adjust with measured calm in response to data, Powell and his colleagues now operate under intense political pressure and public scrutiny from the White House. They face a classic catch-22: face accusations of succumbing to political pressure in case of rapid rate cuts (even if they do so independently); wait too long and risk the potential deepening of an economic slowdown.\n\nThis dynamic could breed reflexive stubbornness. To avoid accusations of capitulating to political pressure, the Fed may instinctively lean towards caution – waiting longer and keeping rates elevated. However, this posture can exacerbate the problem: delayed rate cuts keep monetary policy out of sync with economic conditions, much like a patient who resists mild medication only to require drastic doses once a fever spikes.\n\nThe subsequent high doses of rate cuts could be interpreted by markets as a sign of panic, leading to increased volatility in financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe catch-22 situation could also weigh on the U.S. dollar, a bullish development for dollar-denominated assets like gold and bitcoin.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against major currencies, has dropped nearly 10% this year to 97.64. Meanwhile, bitcoin's price has rallied by 24% to $115,600.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin Could Crash to $107K, XRP MACD Bearish Ahead of Fed Speak & PCE Inflation",
    "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nLast week, the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered its first interest rate rate cut since December, while signaling more easing in the coming months. Yet, despite this dovish move, the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, finished the week with a dragonfly doji on the weekly chart – a classic bullish reversal signal suggesting a USD rally ahead.\n\nThe dragonfly doji gets its name from its distinctive “T” shape, which resembles the delicate wings of a dragonfly or the blade of a bamboo-copter toy. This pattern forms when the open, high, and close prices are nearly identical, accompanied by a long lower shadow that reflects a sharp price decline quickly reversed by buying pressure.\n\nThe DXY initially fell on the news of the Fed rate cut, briefly dipping below the July low of 96.37, only to bounce back and end the week largely unchanged at 97.65, supported by resilience in U.S. Treasury yields.\n\nThe appearance of the dragonfly doji after a notable downtrend and at critical support, as in DXY's case, suggests an impending bullish shift in the market trend.\n\nTraditionally, dollar strength corresponds with weakness in dollar-denominated and broader risk assets, setting an interesting stage for the week ahead.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,958.65\nmirrored this theme in the week ended Sept. 21, forming an indecisive Doji candle at the critical resistance marked by the trendline from 2017 and 2021 bull market peaks. Given that this Doji appeared at such a significant long-term trendline, it leans more bearish, signaling hesitation among bulls to lead the price action and renewed selling pressure from the key hurdle.\n\nOn the daily chart, BTC are teasing a move below the Ichimoku cloud, with the trendline drawn from Sept. 1 lows breached, implying potential downside risk.\n\nThe first line of support is seen at $114,473, the 50-day simple moving average, followed by Sept. 1 lows near $107,300. The past week's high of $118,000 needs to be overcome to weaken the bearish case.\n\nEther\nETH\n$4,005.03\nfaces its own technical dilemma; it hovers below the lower end of the contracting triangle pattern on the daily chart, suggesting renewed seller dominance and potential for deeper losses. The breakdown has put focus on the Aug. 20 low of $4,062 followed by the psychological support of $4,000. The 24-hour high of $4,458 is the level to beat for the bulls.\n\nMeanwhile, XRP presents a frustrating picture for bulls. Despite the recent debut of an XRP ETF in the U.S. on Thursday, the MACD indicator has crossed bearish on the weekly chart, indicating a renewed downside bias. Price indicates that XRP is slipping back to the upper boundary of a descending triangle on the daily chart. Although a tentative breakout occurred last week, it failed to ignite a sustained rally, leaving traders cautious.\n\nThis week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and nine other officials are scheduled to speak, with markets likely to closely watch the same for cues on the interest rate trajectory. While the Fed cut rates last week, signaling more easing ahead, Powell threw cold water over optimism by stressing a data-dependent stance.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointee Stephen Miran will also speak of his independence as a policymaker, having dissented in favor of an outsized 50 basis point rate cut last week.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. core PCE index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, is scheduled to be released. According to Amberdata, the data is expected to show that inflation rose 2.7% year-on-year, with core jumping 2.9% in August, marking a slight uptick from the previous month.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Ethena’s synthetic stablecoin, USDe, has crossed $8.4 billion in supply, adding more than $3.14 billion over 20 days in a surge that outpaced flows into BlackRock’s (BLK) flagship bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds.\n\nAccording to on-chain data curated by the Ethena community, the supply increase since July 17 is the fastest period of growth since the protocol's inception in February 2024.\n\nInflow into the yield-bearing stablecoin exceeds the $2.75 billion added to BlackRock’s ether ETF (ETHA) and the $1.60 billion into its bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in the same period, making the DeFi-native stablecoin the biggest magnet for capital across both on- and off-chain markets in recent weeks.\n\nThe rally has spilled over into Ethena’s governance token ENA, which more than doubled in the past month, though it is down 12% in the past 24 hours as traders hope the long-awaited fee switch will soon activate.\n\nThe protocol has already surpassed most of the thresholds required to distribute revenue to staked ENA holders, with the final benchmark, a favorable yield spread versus rivals, expected to be met soon.\n\nUSDe's reflexive loop\n\nUSDe’s recent growth reflects a powerful reflexive loop built into its core design, as Nansen explained in a recent research report on the Ethena ecosystem.\n\nAs bitcoin and ether prices rally, perpetual funding rates in turn increasingly positive. Ethena captures this funding via delta-neutral hedges, and distributes it as real-time yield to sUSDe holders.\n\nThat higher yield then draws in more users, leading to greater USDe issuance, more hedging, and more protocol revenue.\n\nIn the last month, Ethena has brought in nearly $50 million in feed and $10 million in revenue, according to DeFiLlama data. This makes it the sixth best-performing protocol for monthly fee revenue according to the data aggregator.\n\nENA is currently trading for $0.58.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The Bank of Japan (BOJ) spooked markets Friday by announcing it will begin unwinding its $250 billion in exchange traded funds (ETFs) and Japanese Real Estate Investment Trusts (JREITs), assets it accumulated since 2010 as part of its ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nUnder the plan, the central bank will sell ETFs with a book value of ¥330bn ($2.2 billion) annually, equivalent to ¥620bn ($4.2 billion) at market prices. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda stressed the pace would be deliberately slow, noting it would take more than a century to fully dispose of the holdings.\n\nThe announcement came alongside a decision to hold the bank's benchmark rate at 0.5% by a 7-2 split vote. Uncertainty over the next rate decision, with two members pushing for an immediate hike, has raised expectations of tightening as soon as October. Japan’s core CPI rose to 2.7% in August, well above the BOJ’s 2% target.\n\nThe Nikkei fell over 1% on Friday, while Japan’s 10-year JGB climbed to 1.64%. Crypto dipped alongside, with bitcoin falling back to just above $116,000 after threatening the $118,000 hours earlier.\n\nThe move comes against a fragile backdrop. As CoinDesk has reported, Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio sits near 240%, with bond yields at multi-decade highs. Rising borrowing costs could pose a serious risk to fiscal sustainability.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Michael Saylor: Bitcoin Is Building a Base as 'OG' Hodlers Exit and Big Money Preps",
    "content": "Bitcoin’s recent stretch of muted price action is a sign of strength, not weakness, according to Strategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor.\n\nSpeaking on an episode of Natalie Brunell’s \"Coin Stories\" podcast released Friday, Saylor argued that the market is in a consolidation phase as long-time holders sell portions of their stacks and institutions prepare for bigger allocations. “If you zoom out and look at the one-year chart, bitcoin is up 99%,” he said. “The volatility is coming out of the asset — that’s a really good sign.”\n\nSaylor described the current environment as one where early adopters who bought bitcoin at single-digit prices are selling modest amounts to fund real-world needs, such as housing or tuition.\n\nHe likened it to employees of a high-growth startup liquidating stock options, not as a loss of faith but as a natural step toward maturity. That process, he said, is paving the way for corporations and large funds to enter once volatility falls.\n\nHe dismissed concerns that bitcoin’s lack of cash flows makes it inferior to traditional investments, pointing out that many valuable assets — from land to gold to art — also lack income streams.\n\n“The perfect money has no cash flows,” he said, adding that institutions anchored in decades of equity-and-bond frameworks have been slow to adapt but will eventually be forced to rethink.\n\nA central theme of the conversation was Strategy’s push to reengineer credit markets by using bitcoin as collateral, moving beyond the simple store-of-value narrative.\n\nSaylor said conventional bonds are “yield-starved” and under-collateralized, while bitcoin-backed instruments can be structured to offer higher yields and lower risk.\n\nHe outlined the firm’s suite of preferred-stock products — Strike, Strife, Stride, and Stretch — which are designed to provide investors with yields of up to 12% while being heavily over-collateralized with bitcoin.\n\nBy doing so, Saylor argued, the company is giving bitcoin cash-flow-like qualities, allowing it to slot into both credit and equity indexes. “We’re giving bitcoin cash flow,” he said, framing it as a way to broaden institutional adoption and draw more capital into the ecosystem.\n\nSaylor also addressed why Strategy has yet to be included in the S&P 500 despite its scale and profitability.\n\nHe said the firm only became eligible this year following changes in accounting rules and noted that Tesla also waited beyond its first quarter of eligibility. He expects eventual inclusion as the market grows more comfortable with the bitcoin treasury model, which he dates to late 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, Saylor portrayed the rise of bitcoin treasury companies as analogous to the early days of the petrochemical industry, with multiple products, business models, and fortunes emerging in a chaotic but transformative decade.\n\nHe predicted bitcoin would continue to appreciate at an average rate near 29% annually over the next two decades, fueling new forms of credit and equity instruments.\n\nIn closing, he struck an optimistic tone about both bitcoin and society more broadly, saying much of today’s online toxicity is amplified by bots and paid campaigns rather than genuine discontent.\n\n“Bitcoin is a peaceful, fair, and equitable way for us to settle our differences,” he said. “As everyone embraces it, peace will spread, equity will spread, fairness will spread.”\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Crypto custodian BitGo has filed its first public S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), planning to list Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker BTGO.\n\nThe filing provides a rare look at the company’s business scale. BitGo generated $4.19 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025, nearly quadrupling the $1.12 billion recorded in the same period a year earlier.\n\nProfitability, however, tightened: net income for the half-year fell to $12.6 million, down from $30.9 million in the first half of 2024, as rising operating costs weighed on margins.\n\nIn 2024, BitGo reported $3.08 billion in revenue and $156.6 million in net income, with $54.1 million attributable to common stockholders.\n\nBased in Palo Alto, BitGo was founded in 2013 and built its reputation by offering cold storage and multi-signature wallets for exchanges, hedge funds, and banks. The firm now manages over $90 billion in cryptocurrency on its platform, from 1.14 million users.\n\nThese figures, however, remain concentrated in mostly five cryptocurrencies.\n\nPer the filing: “The value of a majority of our AoP has been, and continues to be, concentrated in a few digital assets held by our clients, including Bitcoin, Sui, Solana, XRP, and Ethereum, which constitute 48.5%, 20.1%, 5.7%, 3.9%, and 3.0% of our AoP [Assets on Platform] as of June 30, 2025, respectively.”\n\nThe S-1 also outlines a dual-class share structure, giving Class B shareholders, including co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe, 15 votes per share compared with one vote for Class A stock. That setup ensures Belshe will retain control after the offering, with BitGo qualifying as a “controlled company” under NYSE rules.\n\nBitGo said IPO proceeds would fund technology development, acquisitions, and stock-based compensation while boosting visibility and financial flexibility.\n\nThe IPO follows public listing moves from other major companies in the cryptocurrency sector, including Circle, Gemini, and CoinDesk’s parent company Bullish.\n\nMore For You\n\nNorth Dakota to Issue Stablecoin With Fiserv as Digital Dollar Trend Expands\n\nThe Fiserv-powered U.S. dollar stablecoin will be available to local banks and credit unions, joining crypto experiments by U.S. states.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Crypto ETF 'Floodgates' Open With SEC Listing Standards, But Price Impact May Be Uneven",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared a path for a flood of new crypto exchange-traded products to hit the market, a move analysts say could reshape how money flows into digital assets.\n\nOn Wednesday, the agency approved generic listing standards for \"commodity-based trust shares\" across regulated exchanges Nasdaq, Cboe BZX and NYSE Arca.\n\nRead more: SEC Makes Spot Crypto ETF Listing Process Easier, Approves Grayscale's Large-Cap Crypto Fund\n\nThe new rules remove the need for each crypto ETP to undergo its own individual rule filing under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act. Instead, an offering whose underlying assets satisfy certain objective eligibility tests — for example, if the crypto trades on a market that is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG), or if the underlying asset's futures contract is listed on a CFTC-regulated designated contract market for at least six months — can be listed using these generic standards.\n\nThe regulatory shift marks a watershed for the crypto industry, removing much of the procedural drag that has historically slowed getting new crypto products to the market, analysts said.\n\n\"[The] crypto ETF floodgates are about to open,\" said Nate Geraci, a well-followed ETF analyst and president of NovaDius Wealth Management.\n\n\"Expect an absolute deluge of new filings and launches,\" he said. \"You may not like it, but crypto is going mainstream via the ETF wrapper.\"\n\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer of digital asset management firm and ETF issuer Bitwise, said the SEC's move is a \"coming of age\" moment for crypto.\n\n\"[It's] a signal that we’ve reached the big leagues,\" he wrote. \"But it’s also just the beginning.\"\n\nHistory backs up predictions that the number of new crypto ETF launches will accelerate under the new regime.\n\nWhen the SEC approved generic listing standards for bond and stock-based products in 2019, the number of ETFs launches more than tripled in a year, rising to 370 from 117 the year before, Hougan pointed out.\n\nHougan cautioned against assuming new crypto ETPs will automatically drive large inflows. \"The mere existence of a crypto ETP does not guarantee significant inflows,\" he wrote. \"You need fundamental interest in the underlying asset.\"\n\nTake, for example, the slow start of spot ether\nETH\n$4,546.33\nETFs. They only began gathering meaningful inflows nearly a year after launch, once stablecoin activity and — by extension — Ethereum's investment narrative picked up, Hougan wrote.\n\nBy contrast, products tied to smaller-cap assets with less tangible use cases may struggle to attract capital absent renewed fundamentals, he added.\n\nStill, he argued that ETPs dramatically lower the barrier for traditional investors, making it far easier for institutional and retail allocators to pivot into crypto once sentiment turns. They also help demystify cryptocurrencies for mainstream audiences when names like\nAVAX\n$28.97\nand Chainlink\nLINK\n$22.45\nappear in brokerage accounts, Hougan said.\n\n\"What we are seeing now are underlying assets further down the value curve being rolled into these wrappers and strategies,\" Paul Howard, senior director of Wincent told CoinDesk in a note. \"For institutions that cannot own spot [crypto] directly, these vehicles provide a wrapper and move liquidity into the ecosystem.\"\n\nThe tokens most likely benefitting from this are large-cap altcoins. \"\nDOGE\n$0.2604\n,\nXRP\n$2.9236\n, Solana\nSOL\n$226.81\n,\nSUI\n$3.4919\n,\nAPT\n$5.2225\nand others are now ushering in the next wave of [products] as investors look for opportunities and applications outside of bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,939.18\nand ETH,\" Howard said.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Click here to sign up for future editions.\n\nA majority of commissioners at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted to streamline the process by which companies could list and trade shares of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as other types of ETFs, through the approval of a generic listing standard.\n\nFor over a decade, the process to (try and) list a spot crypto exchange-traded fund was a 270-day process which usually ended in the ETF application being rejected. Last year, under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the regulator approved the first spot crypto ETFs, for Bitcoin and Ether. Over the past year, we've seen applications for a number of other assets.\n\nThe idea that the SEC would create generic listing standards has been discussed for a few months, at least since the regulator paused the launch of Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund earlier this year.\n\nIn July, the SEC approved GDLC to uplist as an ETF, but almost immediately paused the process. At the time, an individual familiar said the pause was likely intended to give the SEC enough time to develop those generic listing standards.\n\nThis past Wednesday, the SEC approved those standards, letting companies bypass the Exchange Act process if their proposed products meet the standards.\n\nIn a statement, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said, \"By approving these generic listing standards, we are ensuring that our capital markets remain the best place in the world to engage in the cutting-edge innovation of digital assets. This approval helps to maximize investor choice and foster innovation by streamlining the listing process and reducing barriers to access digital asset products within America’s trusted capital markets.\"\n\nA number of spot crypto ETF applications have been waiting for a final decision from the regulator, and it seems likely that a number of new products will come to market in the coming months.\n\nRead more:\n\nSEC Makes Spot Crypto ETF Listing Process Easier, Approves Grayscale's Large-Cap Crypto Fund\n\nCrypto ETF 'Floodgates' Open With SEC Listing Standards, But Price Impact May Be Uneven\n\nThursday\n\nIf you’ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you’d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Bluesky @nikhileshde.bsky.social.\n\nYou can also join the group conversation on Telegram.\n\nSee ya’ll next week!\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

A migration to post-quantum cryptography would require a hard fork, a highly contentious and technically complex process that would need widespread support across the network and would not be backward-compatible.\n\nWhile Yakovenko stressed urgency, others in the crypto community aren’t convinced the threat is near. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, estimated that the technology is still somewhat far away and even making Bitcoin quantum-ready is “relatively simple.”\n\nBitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd pointed out earlier on social media that quantum computers “don’t exist” as “the demos running toy problems do not count.” To Luke Dashjr, another Bitcoin Core contributor, quantum isn’t as much of a threat to Bitcoin now as spam and developer corruption, which the community can now address.\n\nYakovenko argued that advances in artificial intelligence show how quickly lab work can leap into the real world. The moment tech giants like Apple or Google roll out quantum-safe cryptographic stacks, he said, “it’s time to migrate.”\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "content": "NBA forward Kevin Durant has access to his bitcoin again, after being locked out of his Coinbase account for nearly a decade. In that time, the price of BTC rose by more than 17,700%.\n\n“We got this fixed. Account recovery complete,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X, responding to a viral tweet about Durant’s access issues.\n\nThe recovery comes days after Durant and his business partner, Rich Kleiman, discussed the lockout at CNBC’s Game Plan conference. “It’s just a process we haven’t been able to figure out,” Kleiman said. Still, he noted, “bitcoin keeps going up... so, I mean, it’s only benefited us.”\n\nDurant bought bitcoin in 2016 after hearing about it from then-teammates on the Golden State Warriors. At the time, bitcoin traded between $360 and $1,000 and Durant is estimated to have bought at around $650 per coin.\n\nIt’s now hovering near $116,000, according to CoinMarketCap data. Neither Durant nor Kleiman disclosed the size of his holdings.\n\nDurant and Kleiman are investors in Coinbase and have promoted the company through their media outlet, Boardroom.\n\nThe episode comes amid growing frustration among some Coinbase users, who alleged they’ve faced similar issues retrieving account access or getting help from customer support. Armstrong acknowledged the criticism on social media, saying the company is “putting a big focus” on improving customer support.\n\nMore For You\n\nNorth Dakota to Issue Stablecoin With Fiserv as Digital Dollar Trend Expands\n\nThe Fiserv-powered U.S. dollar stablecoin will be available to local banks and credit unions, joining crypto experiments by U.S. states.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The former’s weekly trading pace topped $500 million, with an average open interest of around $189 million.\n\nIts volume is beyond that of Polymarket, which stood at $430 million, and its average open interest of $164 million, which implies “sticker positions on Polymarket and faster turnover on Kalshi.”\n\nPolymarket's longer-term markets, which often stretch over weeks or months, keep user funds locked in for longer periods, essentially.\n\nThis shows up in the open interest-to-volume ratio: Polymarket averaged 0.38, while Kalshi sat lower at 0.29. That suggests Kalshi's users are trading more often, while Polymarket's positions tend to sit.\n\nStill, Polymarket is building out a greater position in the U.S. The platform has cleared its acquisition of QCX, a regulated derivatives exchange, to enter the country again.\n\nIt has also launched earnings-based markets with social investing platform Stocktwits, designed to let stockholders hedge earnings risk and analysts gauge market sentiment in real time.\n\nRead more: Polymarket Weighs $9B Valuation Amid User Surge and CFTC Approval: The Information\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "HBAR Slides 3% as Selling Pressure Intensifies, Finds Support at $0.24",
    "content": "HBAR faced steady downward pressure over the past 23 hours, sliding from $0.25 to $0.24—a 3.38% decline. The token initially attempted to build momentum on September 18, reaching $0.25 by 20:00, but sellers quickly overwhelmed demand near that resistance level. Trading activity spiked at 19:00 with volumes topping 55.91 million, underscoring the intensity of selling. By late evening, HBAR broke below key support zones at $0.25 and $0.24, testing the lower boundary before finding temporary stability.\n\nThe retracement highlights fragile sentiment in the short term, with bears maintaining control as buyers failed to defend critical thresholds. The inability to reclaim lost ground indicates that market participants remain cautious, though consolidation near $0.24 suggests some stabilization. If the level continues to hold, traders may view it as a base for potential sideways movement before a clearer directional trend emerges.\n\nBroader market factors continue to shape HBAR’s outlook. While its energy-efficient Hashgraph technology is often cited as a competitive advantage over traditional blockchains, trading volumes still lag peers like Solana. Still, institutional endorsements from Google, IBM, and Boeing offer a degree of legitimacy that could appeal to investors seeking utility-driven blockchain projects. Its low-cost, high-speed transactions keep HBAR positioned as a contender in the evolving digital asset landscape.\n\nIn the final hour of the observed session, HBAR showed signs of stabilization, hovering tightly around $0.24. The token formed a minor ascending triangle pattern, testing support multiple times while nudging slightly upward. Though modest, this recovery on volume of 2.08 million indicates buyers are tentatively stepping back in. Whether that consolidation evolves into sustained upside momentum remains contingent on overcoming immediate resistance near $0.24.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "'Am I Too Late to Invest' in Crypto? Here's What TradFi Is Asking Wall Street Analysts",
    "content": "Crypto, like the early days of the internet boom, is still in a \"1996\" phase with more room to grow, Jefferies analysts told large institutional investors in a client Q&A report.\n\nThe investment bank, which launched full coverage of the digital assets sector in September, said it is getting strong and diverse interest from its clients. One of the main questions that analysts are fielding is, \"Am I too late to invest?\" to which the analysts, led by Andrew Moss, have answered, \"Relative to the internet, it's 1996 for the digital asset ecosystem, and the next leg of growth has just begun.\"\n\nBy drawing parallels to \"1996,\" Jefferies paints a powerful and specific picture of Wall Street during the early days of the Internet — one that implies that crypto's next leg of growth has only just begun.\n\nThe bank is referring to an era when the Internet was just hitting the mainstream. Netscape Navigator was battling Internet Explorer for dominance, Amazon was a fledgling online bookstore a year away from its IPO, and Google’s search engine wouldn't even exist for another two years.\n\nJefferies' rationale for this \"still early\" thesis is that only a handful of traditional funds currently have exposure to the crypto industry, but that's changing — and that's a good sign.\n\n\"Many are actively developing investment strategies and determining how to allocate funds across tokens, ETFs, digital asset treasury companies (DATs) and public companies with exposure,\" Moss wrote in a research note last week.\n\nSo, where do Jefferies analysts see this opportunity for institutional investors? Spoiler alert: It's not just bitcoin and blockchain's original payments use case. Rather, analysts said, investors should look beyond that.\n\n\"Our view is that too much focus on bitcoin and BTC's price will distract from blockchain technology's disruption potential across industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nJefferies noted that clients are considering exchange-traded funds and digital asset treasury (DATs) companies to gain exposure to the sector, and the bank's analysts see this as a potential short-term bull case. ETFs might remove the final barrier for institutional investments, while DATs could also drive demand for tokens, as these treasury companies are actively and continuously buying up tokens for which they have raised capital.\n\nETFs and DATs aside, Jefferies sees more long-term bull cases in the digital asset sector: tokenization and initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nWith more financial institutions tokenizing assets to enable 24/7 trading and real-time settlement, the Jefferies analysts see \"a paradigm shift\" in blockchain network activity, higher transaction volume and greater value for tokenholders, which could accelerate the next leg of digital asset growth.\n\nAnd then there are initial public offerings (IPOs), a trend that has picked up steam this cycle, which has seen several companies, including Circle, Bullish (CoinDesk's parent company), and Gemini, going public.\n\nJefferies expects this trend to only pick up in the next 18-24 months and balloon to a massive market in the next five years.\n\nWhile exchanges were first to go public, the bank sees a go-public opportunity for distributed ledger developers, tokenization platforms, custodians, token on-off ramps, stablecoin issuers, analytics companies, institutional trading and staking platforms, fund managers and prime brokers.\n\n\"We reiterate our expectation for 10-15 IPOs over the next 18-24 months and a $1 [trillion] public market sector over the next 5 years,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nDriving home the parallel of the 1996 internet era, the firm's advice to clients asking how to invest echoes the lessons of the early Internet: be selective and focus on lasting utility.\n\nThe analysts pointed out that only six of the top 20 tokens from January 2018 remain in the top 20 today — a dynamic similar to the dot-com era, when early leaders like AltaVista and Lycos were eventually displaced.\n\nA great divergence is expected to continue as capital shifts from speculative assets to tokens that power real applications. The playbook, Jefferies suggests, is to analyze tokens like early-stage tech startups, prioritizing “adoption, development, usage and use case” over fleeting revenue spikes of some blockchains.\n\nMore For You\n\nNorth Dakota to Issue Stablecoin With Fiserv as Digital Dollar Trend Expands\n\nThe Fiserv-powered U.S. dollar stablecoin will be available to local banks and credit unions, joining crypto experiments by U.S. states.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Between Sept. 18 at 15:00 and Sept. 19 at 14:00, XLM fell 3.58% from $0.40 to $0.39, with volumes surpassing the 24-hour average of 22.33 million tokens.

Still, the broader trend remains bearish, with resistance consolidating around the $0.40 threshold where previous rebounds have faltered on elevated volume.

    "content": "After seven months of inactivity, Michigan's Bitcoin Reserve Bill, HB 4087, made progress Thursday by advancing to the second reading in the state House of Representatives.\n\nThe bill, introduced in February, aims to establish a strategic bitcoin\nBTC\n$124,013.34\nreserve by authorizing the state treasury to invest up to 10% of its reserves in the largest cryptocurrency and possibly others. It has now been referred to the Committee on Government Operations.\n\nIf approved, Michigan would join the three states — Texas, New Hampshire and Arizona — that have enacted bitcoin reserve laws. While Texas allocated $10 million to purchase BTC in June, the other two have yet to fund the reserve with state money.\n\nRecently, the U.S. House directed the Treasury Department to study the feasibility and governance of a strategic bitcoin reserve, including key areas such as custody, cybersecurity and accounting standards.\n\nSovereign adoption of bitcoin has emerged as one of the defining trends of 2025, with several U.S. states and countries considering or implementing BTC reserves as part of their public finance strategy. That's in addition to the growing corporate adoption of bitcoin in company treasuries.\n\nThis institutional embrace has contributed to a significant boost in bitcoin’s market valuation.

    "content": "Binance, the largest global crypto exchange, is still under the constraints of a massive, $4.3 billion U.S. enforcement action, though Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats are asking the Trump administration about reports that it's easing off on those orders.\n\nIn 2023, the major digital assets platform agreed to settle with U.S. authorities for sanctions violations, insufficient money-laundering protections and operating without proper licensing, and its leader, Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, pleaded guilty to Bank Secrecy Act violations, stepping down from the company and serving a brief prison sentence. Warren and two other senators, Richard Blumenthal and Mazie Hirono questioned Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter this week, asking about reports by outlets including Bloomberg News that the company has spoken to the U.S. about dropping its independent compliance monitor.\n\nThe senators also raised the continuing financial ties between the family of President Donald Trump and Binance, through their stake in World Liberty Financial.\n\n\"These reports make it more important than ever that the public understand the Trump administration’s interactions with, and relationship to, Binance and its employees,\" they wrote, demanding \"meaningful\" answers to several questions about the U.S. Department of Justice's interactions with Binance, including whether a pardon is being considered for CZ.\n\nAs the markets contemplated a potential return of CZ, the Binance-tied BNB token rocketed over $1,000 for the first time, leaping over SOL to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThe prosecution of Binance in the U.S., where the independent Binance.US arm still operates, occurred under the previous administration, and the arrival of President Trump and his pro-crypto choices to be regulators and law enforcement officials has rapidly shifted the stance of the U.S. government. Many of the efforts of previous officials to address digital assets market risks and the dangers of their use in illicit finance and drug trafficking have been overtaken by the administration's interest in financial innovation and establishing the U.S. as a global crypto hub.\n\nIn May, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to drop its long-running lawsuit against Binance.\n\nRead More: BNB Hits $1,000 All-Time High as Binance Nears DOJ Deal, Rumors of CZ’s Return Grow\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,993.71\ntraders continue to eye downside volatility, hedging their bullish exposure despite recent positive signals, such as the Federal Reserve’s rate cut, crypto derivatives exchange Deribit's CEO Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points and signaled an additional 50 basis points of easing expected by year-end. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled a new generic listing standard for crypto ETFs, which is set to accelerate the approval process.\n\nMeanwhile, Deribit's DVOL index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility, remains subdued at around 24%, the lowest in two years.\n\nHistorically, bullish sentiment is strong in such situations, causing call options – bets on price increases in BTC – to become more expensive than put options, which provide insurance against price declines. However, on Deribit, put options continue to trade at a premium across all time frames.\n\n“Skew across all time frames remains flat to negative,” Strijers explained. “We continue to see demand for puts to hedge downside exposure, while call overwriting flows are pressuring the topside.” Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange, accounting for over 80% of the global activity.\n\nOptions skew measures the implied volatility difference between call and put options for a given expiration. A negative skew indicates bearish sentiment, with investors expecting a price drop; a positive skew reflects bullish expectations.\n\nCurrently, the seven, 30, 60, and 90 day skews are slightly negative, with the 180 day skew neutral, according to data source Amberdata.\n\nThis indicates persistent concerns about a possible BTC correction.\n\nInvestors buying puts may be concerned that the Fed’s easing was already factored into the market ahead of the decision and that a deteriorating economic outlook could reduce demand for riskier assets, such as bitcoin.\n\n\"After the Fed’s decision, some of the earlier optimism has faded. The market now seems to be waiting for the next catalyst — whether macro or crypto-specific — to break the stalemate and push option positioning out of its current balance between caution and optimism,\" Strijers said.\n\nSidrah Fariq, global head of retail sales and business development at Deribit, said the persistent put bias represents market maturity.\n\n\"In some sense, BTC options are behaving more like S&P index options - a sign of maturity, but also of market caution,\" Fariq said.\n\nAdditionally, traders writing covered calls – selling call options against their spot holdings to collect premium – which may be contributing to the put bias, particularly in longer-dated options. This strategy generates additional income but can cap upside potential.\n\nCovered call has emerged as a popular strategy among BTC, ETH and XRP traders in recent years.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe SEC, as market regulator, now couldn’t be more pro-crypto if it tried! On Thursday, a spot ETF tied to one of the least \"serious” cryptocurrencies —\nDOGE\n$0.2604\n— debuted in the U.S. alongside payments-focused XRP.\n\nUnlike bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,993.71\n, ether\nETH\n$4,529.03\nand stablecoins, which act as a stores of value and facilitate decentralized finance, memecoins like DOGE are driven entirely by tweets, and cult-like fandom, just like baseball or pro-wrestling cards. Some observers are understandably worried that wrapping such an asset in an ETF gives it a false veneer of legitimacy, putting investors at risk.\n\nYou might call this the “peak pro-crypto SEC” moment, when regulators become so friendly that even memecoins get their own institutional wrapper. And, coincidentally, peak liquidity moment too, because when cash flows freely, traders get more adventurous. That's one reason why the Fed may need to go slow with rate cuts.\n\nThe crypto market seems unimpressed. DOGE dropped over 2% in 24 hours, a sharp contrast to 2021, when a single tweet from Elon Musk could send it skyrocketing. The entire meme token gang is taking a hit; names like M, PUMP, and TOSHI are down nearly 10% in the same period.\n\nXRP isn’t getting off easily either, falling 2%. Bitcoin and ether remain under pressure too, with traders aggressively seeking downside protection in the options market. The CoinDesk 20 Index was 1.3% lower at press time.\n\nIn other news, Consensys CEO reportedly said a Metamask token is arriving sooner than expected. Popular newsletter writer Christine Kim relayed that Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade is scheduled for Dec. 3. This upgrade bundles multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals focused on enhancing data availability and reducing costs for layer-2 rollups.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional markets aren’t making it easy for crypto bulls. The dollar index and Treasury yields edged higher. The Bank of Japan stayed put on rates, with two dissenters signaling hikes in the coming months. The central bank announced the gradual selling of ETFs to slim its bloated balance sheet.

    "title": "Grvt Raises $19M to Bring Privacy and Scale to On-Chain Finance",
    "content": "Grvt (pronounced \"gravity\"), a decentralized exchange (DEX) focused on privacy in on-chain finance, has raised $19 million in Series A funding.\n\nThe round was co-led by ZKsync, its foundational technology partner, along with Further Ventures, EigenCloud (formerly EigenLayer) and 500 Global, the company announced via email on Thursday.\n\nBuilt on the ZKsync Validium L2, Grvt uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to ensure transactions inherit Ethereum-level security while keeping trade details private and settlement costs low. The company says this architecture addresses long-standing barriers to mainstream adoption of on-chain finance: privacy, scalability and accessibility.\n\nZK technology is a cryptographic method in which one party can demonstrate to another that a certain piece of information is true, without revealing anything about said information. This is an important facet of blockchain-based finance as it allows users to verify transactions and transfers without revealing anything about the sender, receiver, amount.\n\n“Privacy is uncompromising for the future of on-chain trading and investing,” said co-founder and CEO Hong Yea, adding that Grvt aims to set the standard for how zero-knowledge cryptography powers financial markets.\n\nThe raise comes amid a resurgence in Ethereum activity, with August’s on-chain volume topping $320 billion, its highest since mid-2021. Backers see Grvt as a potential liquidity hub for a trillion-dollar on-chain finance market, with applications spanning cross-exchange vaults, cross-chain interoperability, real-world assets, and structured options, according to the announcement.\n\nMore For You\n\nNorth Dakota to Issue Stablecoin With Fiserv as Digital Dollar Trend Expands\n\nThe Fiserv-powered U.S. dollar stablecoin will be available to local banks and credit unions, joining crypto experiments by U.S. states.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Pure-play bitcoin\nBTC\n$124,009.60\nmining stocks are waking up from their slumber after lagging behind those pivoting to the red-hot data center business.\n\nPure-play miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) surged 10% and 17% on Thursday, leading gains among the CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF members.\n\nThere are two key factors that may be driving the sharp gains.\n\nThe first is the idea that investors could be front-running expectations of a strong year-end for bitcoin, a period that has historically delivered some of its most bullish returns. BTC is climbing towards $118,000 following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, up 2.2% on Thursday and trading only 5% below its all-time high.\n\nWith sentiment improving, miners with significant BTC stash on the balance sheet could be leveraged plays on bitcoin's potential rally to new records. MARA and CleanSpark remain the sector’s largest BTC holders with 52,477 ($6.2 billion) and 12,703 ($1.5 billion) tokens, respectively. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of BTC, is up 7% as well today.\n\nThe second driver could be investors rotating profits from stocks in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have enjoyed outsized gains over the past months. Iren Energy (IREN), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitfarms (BITF) have all surged, with Bitfarms up 150% in September alone, IREN gaining over 600% since April and CIFR advancing 500% during the same period.

    "title": "Ex-Kraken CLO Says Solana Delivers on Promises Ethereum 'Made Almost a Decade Ago’",
    "content": "New comments from Solmate’s Marco Santori and two widely followed analysts put the focus on SOL's $238 pivot and what would confirm higher prices.\n\nIn an X thread, Santori, a former Kraken CLO, introduced Solmate, which he described as “brand new Solana infrastructure” for the UAE, adding that he will be CEO.\n\nHe said Solmate is aligned with the Solana Foundation and backed by UAE investors, and he highlighted additional support from Ark Invest, which he characterized as a rare DAT PIPE investment by an ETF.\n\nSantori framed Solmate’s remit as a digital asset treasury and crypto infrastructure company focused on SOL-per-share growth for shareholders.\n\nSantori outlined the strategy behind the vehicle by calling digital asset treasuries “capital accumulation machines.” In his view, the best DAT is the one with the best access to capital, and he argued the UAE is “the Capitol of Capital.”\n\nHe said Solmate’s sponsors include the Pulsar Group, positioning the firm to raise fiat and convert it into crypto more efficiently than individual investors.\n\nOn operations, Santori said Solmate is partnering with RockawayX, which he called a leader in staking infrastructure, and that Viktor Fischer will join the board.\n\nThe plan includes standing up bare-metal validators in Abu Dhabi to target performance and reliability for staking, with more initiatives to follow.\n\nSantori also made a broader case for the Solana ecosystem.\n\nHe said Solana is the “fastest, most used” blockchain and is growing faster than comparable networks. He contrasted it with Ethereum by saying Solana “delivers what Ethereum promised,” and closed the thread with an emphatic “I’m all in on it.”\n\nAnalyst Rekt Capital said SOL has broken a long-term downtrend and is now retesting about $238 —f ormerly major monthly resistance —a s support on the weekly chart. He sees a successful retest as confirmation that the old ceiling has flipped to a floor, which would keep the path open for attempts at new all-time highs.\n\nTrader KALEO said “$1,000+ sol isn’t a meme,” presenting four-figure prices as plausible; he did not specify timing in the post.\n\nTime window. The analysis covers Sept. 17, 2025, 19:00 UTC to Sept. 18, 2025, 18:00 UTC.\n\nWhat happened. During that window, SOL moved from $233.78 to $250.59 (about +7.2%), swinging about $19.72 in total. That tells us buyers were generally in control during this period.\n\nWhere buyers showed up. Around 22:00 UTC on Sept. 17, 2025, price pushed above ~$245 on much heavier trading (~2.32M units). “Heavier trading” means more coins changed hands than usual.\n\nWhen price climbs on bigger-than-normal activity, it’s a sign demand is strong enough to overcome sellers. After that push, ~$245 started acting like a floor (support) — traders were willing to buy dips there.\n\nWhere sellers pushed back. At 17:00 UTC on Sept. 18, 2025, price stalled near ~$253.44 on very high trading (~2.88M units). That shows ~$253 is a ceiling (resistance) — many traders chose to sell or take profit there, absorbing buy orders.\n\nHow the window ended. Between 17:56 UTC and 18:55 UTC on Sept. 18, 2025, price eased from $251.55 to $250.40. That small, orderly fade after a strong run is typical cool-off or consolidation — the market catching its breath rather than reversing trend.\n\nLevels to watch:\n\nBottom line. Buyers defended ~$245; sellers capped ~$253. A daily/4-hour close above ~$253 (UTC) would likely invite a push toward ~$255–$260. A drop below ~$245 would likely bring a check of $242–$243, then ~$238.\n\n24-hour chart (ending Sept. 18, 19:51 UTC): Range $237.01–$252.81; coiling above ~$245 with a ceiling ~$252–$253. Hold ~$245 and a push through ~$253 would likely target ~$255–$260; lose ~$245 and the path is $242–$243, then ~$238.\n\nOne-month chart (ending Sept. 18, 19:52 UTC): Uptrend of higher highs/lows (roughly $179.71 → $250.50). $238 is the pivot: above it keeps the breakout case clean; below it suggests a pause toward the low $230s before another try higher.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Tristan Thompson Taps Somnia to Bring Basketball Fandom On-Chain",
    "content": "NBA champion Tristan Thompson is teaming up with Improbable CEO Herman Narula and co-founder Hadi Teherany to roll out a new web3 experience designed to reinvent basketball fandom for the digital era.\n\nThe project, named basketball.fun, will debut in October ahead of the NBA season and will attempt to gamify the way fans interact with players and games, Thompson announced.\n\nIt has been developed on Somnia, a layer 1 blockchain that went live at the start of this month, already notching billions of dollars worth of trading volume in its first two weeks.\n\n“This is how we experience moments together, it’s not just about basketball,” Tristan Thompson said in a press release. “We’re creating something for the fans that lives beyond the game, where your presence, passion, and play actually matter.”\n\nUnlike traditional fantasy sports or fan tokens, the platform will tokenize NBA players with values that fluctuate in real time based on sentiment and performance. Fans will be able to assemble rosters, speculate on rising talent, and earn rewards tied to their predictions and engagement.\n\n“The way fans value and perceive players should be different than owners and news networks,” Teherany said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We’re trying to give power back to the fan — not just to predict who they think is great, but to actually earn incentives from it. Imagine being able to prove that the fan consensus on a rookie’s potential is more accurate than a team’s front office.”\n\nTeherany stressed that the app won’t launch with a native token, distancing itself from projects like Socios that hinge on token price. Instead, players will hold in-app value that reflects fan sentiment and game outcomes.\n\nAsked why the team chose to build on Somnia instead of more established chains like Solana or Avalanche, Teherany pointed to both relationships and philosophy.\n\n“Everything in this industry comes from authentic relationships,” he said. “When we met Herman Narula, it was an alignment of vision. He’s not chasing short-term token hype but is committed to building sports and entertainment on-chain for the long term. That gave us confidence that this wouldn’t just be valued on market speculation.”\n\nThe decision also came after lessons learned from a previous project, TracyAI, which Teherany said became too dependent on token performance. This time, the focus is on infrastructure, gamification, and sustainability.\n\nSomnia went live on Sep. 2, following a six-month testnet that processed over 10 billion transactions and onboarded 118 million wallets. Backed by UK-based metaverse company Improbable, the network is positioning itself as the fastest EVM-compatible chain, claiming to handle more than one million transactions per second with sub-second finality.\n\nAt launch, Somnia onboarded 60 validators, including Google Cloud, and has integrated with protocols like LayerZero, Sequence, and Thirdweb. Its native token, SOMI, has nearly doubled in value since launch and is already processing billions in daily volume.\n\nFor Teherany, Somnia’s traction adds credibility: “They’ve done billions in daily volume, bigger than some of the major exchanges. That’s a testament to what they’re building—and what we’re building on top of it.”\n\nThe project’s first major reveal is scheduled for Korea Blockchain Week, where Thompson will share his vision alongside Narula and Teherany. Attendees of Somnia House, the network’s flagship side event in Seoul on September 23, will get an early look at the app and roadmap.\n\n“We want to make this as approachable as possible,” Teherany said. “The blockchain layer should feel invisible. Whether you’re a crypto native or just a basketball fan, you’ll be able to join, play, and help define the narrative of the sport.”\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Strategy (MSTR) is approaching its 200 day simple moving average (200SMA), a widely followed technical indicator that smooths out price action by calculating the average closing price over the past 200 trading days. Traders often view it as a key marker for long-term trend direction.\n\nMSTR is currently trading just over $350, slightly below the 200SMA at $355. The stock has been under this level since Aug. 25, with the only other period of weakness this year coming in April during the so-called Trump tariff tantrum. On Thursday, shares jumped 6%, rebounding from a support line last tested in September 2024 and April 2025.\n\nThe rally coincides with strength in bitcoin, which is nearing $118,000, almost a one-month high. Bitcoin is up more than 8% in September, putting it on pace for its best September since at least 2013. Year-to-date, MSTR has gained 18% compared to bitcoin’s 22% rise.\n\nElsewhere in the bitcoin treasury space, companies continue to get hit hard.

Trading volume assumptions do not yet price in any spot market appreciation, and projected contributions from the U.S. business and options rollout reflect cautious timelines.\n\nCanaccord reiterated its buy rating and unchanged $68 target.\n\nInvestment bank KBW said it viewed the BitLicense and Money Transmission License wins as positive for \"near-term platform expansion into the United States with the inclusion of New York state.\"\n\nThat said, Bullish still faces significant challenges in building brand recognition in new markets, where established players have long provided turn-key exchange solutions, KBW said.\n\nThe bank maintained its market perform rating on Bullish shares and $55 price target.\n\nBullish shares were up over 8%, trading around $58.18 at publication time.\n\nRead more: Wall Street Sees U.S. Entry as Catalyst for Bullish’s Next Leg Up\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "U.S.-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) has rolled out a USDC lending product that allows its customers to earn yield directly from the exchange’s app, deepening its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe feature is powered by Morpho, a protocol that routes deposits through curated “vaults” managed by Steakhouse Financial, according to a blogpost on Thursday\n\nWhen users deposit USDC, their funds are lent out to borrowers — including those already tapping Coinbase’s crypto-backed loans secured by bitcoin. The interest borrowers pay generates returns for depositors, who can withdraw anytime without lockups.\n\nCoinbase said the setup creates a flywheel effect where its lending and borrowing products reinforce each other. The launch follows more than $900 million in loans originated through Coinbase’s crypto-backed loan service. Together, the two offerings form what the company calls its first complete onchain lending and borrowing ecosystem.\n\nBy outsourcing the backend to Morpho’s smart contracts while keeping the Coinbase interface, the company is betting on what it calls the “DeFi mullet” approach: a familiar fintech user experience at the front, powered by open, decentralized infrastructure in the back.\n\nFor users, the product offers an easier way into decentralized lending markets without leaving Coinbase’s platform. For Morpho, it underscores the argument that the future of finance will be built on open networks, but accessed through trusted gateways.\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Repeated testing of the $0.40 resistance zone highlighted the threshold as a key battleground, while support consolidated just below, pointing to steady accumulation.\n\nThe final hour of trading proved particularly strong, with XLM rising from $0.40 to a session high of $0.40 at 15:36, backed by a surge in volume to 7.50 million—roughly 24 times the typical hourly level. This outsized activity reinforced a breakout move, with buyers consistently defending the $0.40 level. Market behavior suggested sustained institutional participation, laying the foundation for an extension of the 24-hour uptrend.\n\nAcross the period, XLM appreciated nearly 4%, climbing from $0.38 to $0.40. Trading data pointed to steady institutional positioning, with high-volume moves suggesting longer-term accumulation strategies rather than short-term speculative flows.

Realized volatility measures how much an asset’s price has actually fluctuated over a specific past period. In other words, it quantifies the price swings that have already happened, giving a view of historical price turbulence.\n\nSince May, the cryptocurrency has entered a narrowing price range, characterized by converging trendlines that connect lower highs and higher lows. The direction in which the range eventually resolves will likely set the tone for the next big move.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, SHIB's dollar-denominated price has gained over 2%. According to CoinDesk analytics, the token achieved a notable technical breakthrough, reaching an intraday peak of $0.000013584 at 22:00 on Sept. 17, underpinned by extraordinary trading volumes of 2.08 trillion tokens.\n\nNotably, critical resistance materialized around the $0.000013584 threshold, where price action reversed amid heightened volume, whilst robust support established itself near $0.000012882, delineating a trading corridor of $0.000007020 or 5%.\n\nAmid this, whale activity intensified, with over 7 trillion tokens moved on-chain on Saturday, including 512 billion SHIB transferred from Kraken to undisclosed addresses.\n\nThe Binance-listed SHIB-DOGE pair, which represents SHIB's price relative to DOGE, has dropped to 0.0000472, the lowest since the exchange listed the pair in November 2021.\n\nThe pair has recently dived out of a sideways pattern, marking a continuation of the prolonged downtrend from March 2024 highs.

    "content": "The total amount of capital locked on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols hit $170 billion on Thursday, a landmark figure as now all of the the losses from the 2022 Terra/LUNA ecosystem collapse and subsequent bear market have been erased.\n\nWhile Ethereum still commands the lion's share of capital at 59%, newcomers including Coinbase-backed layer 2 network Base, HyperLiquid's layer 1 blockchain and Sui have begun to chip away at Ethereum's dominance, collectively amassing more than $10 billion worth of total value locked (TVL), representing around 6%.\n\nInvestor trends have shifted in this recent cycle; institutional adoption of ether has led to outflows from traditional liquid staking products like Lido into institutional staking products like Figment, while there has also been growth in Solana and BNB Chain due to a seismic rise in memecoin activity.\n\nSolana is now the second largest blockchain in terms of DeFi with $14.4 billion in TVL with BNB chain behind that with $8.2 billion.\n\nThe previous bull market between January 2021 and April 2022 saw rapid growth across the DeFi ecosystem, with TVL jumping from $16 billion to $202 billion. This cycle has been more measured with a slow but steady gain from $42 billion in October 2022 to $170 billion in September 2025.\n\nThe rise suggests crypto investors might be learning from their mistakes of 2022 and have created a more mature ecosytem to lend, borrow and generate yield.\n\nThe Terra implosion saw $100 billion worth of TVL wiped off almost overnight as investors, including bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, took a gung ho approach on an algorithmic stablecoin that ultimately failed — leading to contagion and bad debt spreading across the entire industry.\n\nTerra was the crypto-form of a classic \"dividend trap,\" a product that offered yields that were too good to be true but ultimately turned out to be unsustainable.\n\nNow, yields have receded with lending protocol Aave offering a 5.2% yield on stablecoins while restaking protocol Ether.fi is offering 11.1%, far less than the 20% Terra was offering on its stablecoin.\n\nWith the DeFi sector now being back where it was before the Terra debacle, albeit with more sustainable yields, critics will ask how can the market continue to grow to topple 2021's record high in terms of TVL.\n\nThe answer to that is nuanced. While it's true that institutional adoption and inflows to assets like ether and solana will continue to drive a bullish narrative, the industry is still battling with rampant hacks, scams and rug pulls connected to memecoins.\n\nCrypto investors lost $2.5 billion to hacks and scams in the first half of 2025 and in order for the industry to truly become a viable alternative to traditional finance, investors need to be protected.\n\nUnlike traditional finance where deposits are often insured and protected, the very essence of cryptocurrencies means that you are on your own; if you lose your keys, get phished or hacked, there is no helpline to call.\n\nThe next iteration of DeFi, whether that is in this cycle or the next, will need to focus on security and hack prevention — because the industry is still one major implosion away from another crypto winter.\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The case began in June 2024 after a tip from Europol came in, which flagged the platform’s alleged non-compliance with Canadian law.\n\nInvestigators determined that TradeOgre had failed to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as a money services business and neglected to verify the identities of its clients, the authorities claim.\n\nThe RCMP allege that most of the funds passing through TradeOgre stemmed from illicit sources. By offering anonymous account creation, the platform provided an easy gateway for organized crime groups seeking to conceal the origins of their money, they claim.\n\n\"The transaction data obtained from the platform will be analyzed and charges may follow.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,771.52\n, rose following the Federal Reserve’s long-anticipated 25 basis-point rate cut and hints of additional easing by the year-end despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell's more hawkish tone at the following press conference.\n\nThe CoinDesk 20 Index was recently up 3% over 24 hours with all members in the green.\n\nTraders can now focus on crypto-specific developments. One standout is the SEC’s approval of \"accelerated basis\" listing standards for crypto ETFs, which cuts approval times to about 75 days from 240 days. A similar generic listing standard for traditional markets spurred a sharp increase in listings, as noted by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas.\n\nAnother big story comes from DeFi giant Aave, which unveiled its V4 roadmap featuring a shift to ERC-4626 share accounting. Here’s the translation: Under Aave V3, if you deposited 100 DAI, the number of interest-bearing aTokens you hold would rise over time. With V4, you’ll still have 100 tokens, but the value of each token will increase instead.\n\nThis change promises cleaner integrations, easier tax treatment, and better compatibility with other DeFi protocols. The roadmap also signals a strategic pullback from less productive deployments on certain layer-2 and alternative layer-1 networks. The price of the AAVE token has risen over 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nIn other news, decentralized blockchain bridge Wormhole announced new tokenomics, offering increased earning opportunities for token holders active in governance, along with a strategic reserve.\n\nA popular post by pseudonymous observer G3ronimo made waves, arguing that Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is significantly undervalued. G3ronimo advocates using discounted cash flow (DCF) models over traditional multiples thanks to HYPE’s unique cash flow dynamics.\n\nAcross traditional markets, the dollar remains well above its July lows — suggesting the Fed’s rate cuts were already priced in. The yen weakened against the dollar ahead of Friday’s Bank of Japan rate decision, with expectations for steady rates and hawkish forward guidance.

This will help investors earn yield even during volatile periods.\n\nNigel Khakoo, VP and Global Head of Trading and Markets at Ripple, called the collaboration a game changer.\n\n“2025 has been marked by a series of industry-firsts when it comes to traditional financial institutions moving onchain – and the linkup between Ripple, DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable repo trades for a tokenised money market fund with a regulated, stable and liquid mode of exchange, such as RLUSD, is truly a game-changer,” Khakoo said in an email announcement shared with CoinDesk.\n\n“Investors can also seamlessly rebalance their portfolios between a stablecoin and a yield-generating money market fund, all within a single, trusted ecosystem, unlocking real-world capital efficiency, utility and liquidity that institutions demand,” Khakoo added.\n\nLim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange, said that the collaboration is evidence of how tokenised securities can play that role while injecting greater efficiency and liquidity in global financial markets.\n\nAdditionally, DBS is considering allowing holders of sgBENJI tokens to pledge their tokens as collateral to borrow funds from the bank of third-party platforms.\n\nThe move will open new liquidity options for investors holding sgBENJI tokens, enabling them to leverage their digital assets to obtain credit while still retaining exposure to the underlying yield-generating money market fund.\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "BTC, XRP, SOL, DOGE Resume Slow Grind Higher After Fed, Dollar Index Is Resilient Too",
    "content": "Analysts told CoinDesk early this week that major cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin would resume their slow grind higher following Wednesday's Fed rate cut.\n\nThat's exactly what has happened since the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points to 4% late Wednesday. The central bank also hinted rapid easing in the next 12 months.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,647.07\n, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, topped $117,900, the highest level since Aug. 17, ending the sideways trend since Friday and resuming the slow recovery from early September lows near $107,200, CoinDesk data show. As of writing, the cryptocurrency was up nearly 1% on a 24-hour basis.\n\nEthereum's ether\nETH\n$4,531.43\ntoken, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was up 2.7%, but remained locked within the four-week-long narrowing price range, or contracting triangle, as noted by CoinDesk early this week.\n\nOther majors such as\nDOGE\n$0.2601\n, solana\nSOL\n$227.95\nand BNB\nBNB\n$1,319.38\nwere up over 4% while the payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP traded nearly 3% higher, looking to build upside momentum in the wake of a bullish descending triangle breakout.\n\nProgrammable blockchain Solana's SOL token briefly topped $245, almost testing the weekend high, as CME's decision to offer SOL options from Oct. 13 raised hopes of increased institutional participation. These options will help institutions manage their exposure more effectively. The CME is also going to debut XRP options on the same day.\n\nMatt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said that the Fed's openness to accelerate the pace of easing is creating an asymmetric setup for bitcoin.\n\n\"The dots [interest rate projections] leaned more dovish, signaling the Fed is open to accelerating the pace of easing if conditions demand it. That repricing risk is now front and center - creating an asymmetric setup for Bitcoin. While today’s 25bps cut provided the spark, it is the path implied by the dots - more than the cut itself - that may set the stage for Bitcoin to challenge new highs into year-end,\" Mena said in an email to CoinDesk.\n\nHe added that bitcoin could set an all-time high above $124,000 by the end of October, with ether topping the $5,000 psychological barrier.\n\nThe path to new lifetime highs, however, may not be smooth, as the dollar is showing signs of life.\n\nDespite the dovish Fed rate projections, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, including the euro, has bounced to 97.30, quickly recovering from the initial drop below the July 1 low of 96.37.\n\nPerhaps the Fed's dovishness is already factored in by the foreign exchange markets. After all, the DXY has dropped 10% this year largely on the back of Fed rate cut bets. BTC, too, has rallied by 25% this year, hitting new highs above $124,000 in August, supported by dovish Fed expectations.\n\nThe dollar’s resilience likely reflects Chairman Jerome Powell’s emphasis that rapid, successive rate cuts are not guaranteed. He also highlighted that quantitative tightening (balance sheet runoff) remains in effect and inflation continues to run high. These remarks dampened the optimism sparked by the dovish dot plot projections.\n\nA strong bounce in the DXY could lead to financial tightening, potentially weighing on BTC and other risk assets.\n\nSophisticated market participants are pricing tail risk, according to crypto financial platform BloFin.\n\nTail risk refers to low-probability, high-impact events, such as market crashes or major economic crises, that cause disproportionately large losses, often occurring at the \"tails\" of a probability distribution.\n\n\"As one of the most interest rate-sensitive assets, the recent increase in interest rate risk has led to a growing demand for tail protection, prompting market makers and traders to incorporate more interest rate risk into their pricing. Meanwhile, block trades data also includes a short-dated (about 4DTE) put spread order with 2,000 contracts (clearly intended for tail protection), which is not often seen,\" BloFin told CoinDesk.\n\nA put spread is a strategy designed to profit from a decline in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, BTC.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Fed Cuts Rate in 'Risk Management' Move as Bitcoin Eyes Possible Upside",
    "content": "The Federal Reserve has returned to easing mode after ten months of taking a wait and see approach on the U.S. economy.\n\nIn a widely expected move on Wednesday, the U.S. central bank cut its benchmark fed funds interest rate range by 25 basis points to 4%-4.25%, the lowest since December 2022, in what Fed chair Jerome Powell called a \"risk management cut.\"\n\nThe Fed acknowledged that economic growth in the first half of the year \"moderated\" and the job market has \"slowed.\" This slowdown, Powell said during a press conference, is mostly due to changes in immigration. Nevertheless, there was no widespread support for a larger cut, he said, and that the Fed was right to wait to lower rates and will not be rushed to cut more aggressively.\n\nThe decision follows growing signs that the U.S. labor market has begun to decisively weaken, the latest being the August employment report which showed the addition of just 22,000 jobs to the economy and the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.\n\n\"The Fed is under pressure to lean more dovish, and any successor to Powell is likely to favor faster and deeper rate reductions,\" Chris Rhine, Head of Liquid Active Strategies at Galaxy, said. \"While risk assets had largely priced in this cut, the updated dot plot aligns with recent sell-side forecasts, pointing to another 50bps of cuts ahead.\"\n\nAlongside that data, revisions to previous months' reports showed far less jobs had been created than previously thought.\n\nAdded to that was political pressure in the form of President Trump's repeated criticisms of the Fed’s hesitancy to act in the face of what he insists has been softening inflation. Powell said during Wednesday's press conference that the Fed is \"strongly committed to maintaining [its] independence.\"\n\nIn the minutes following the rate cut, the price of bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,749.74\nrose about 1% before giving up gains. It is currently down about 1.5% since the decision, trading at $115,092.\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes — which have been repeatedly carving out record highs for weeks ahead of the Fed move — also briefly rose on the news but later fell sharply. Gold followed a similar move.\n\n\"The dots leaned more dovish, signaling the Fed is open to accelerating the pace of easing if conditions demand it,\" said Matt Mena, Crypto Research Strategist at 21Shares. \"That repricing risk is now front and center - creating an asymmetric setup for Bitcoin. While today’s 25bps cut provided the spark, it is the path implied by the dots - more than the cut itself - that may set the stage for Bitcoin to challenge new highs into year-end.”\n\nA glance at the Fed's dot plot shows that the Commission is torn about how the rest of the year will unfold. A slight majority of participants of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believe there could be two more rate cuts this year.\n\nSeven out of the 19 participants see rates kept steady throughout the year.\n\nUPDATE (September 17, 18:18 UTC): Adds dot plot projections and markets update alongside commentary.\n\nUPDATE (September 17, 18:39 UTC): Adds quote on markets.\n\nUPDATE (September 17, 18:45 UTC): Adds quotes from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Asia Morning Briefing: Bittensor’s dTAO Shows a Retail Path to AI Exposure Beyond Robinhood’s SPVs",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nRobinhood got all kinds of attention earlier this year when it claimed to be able to offer its retail users exposure to OpenAI’s growth story via tokenized shares backed by a special purpose vehicle.\n\nCounsel for OpenAI, has warned that these tokens do not constitute equity and claimed that the whole thing is unauthorized, which could potentially mean it could be a risky investment for the token holders.\n\nThis gets at a bigger question of investor access. The hottest AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, remain firmly private, their growth captured by venture capital funds and strategic backers like Microsoft or Google.\n\nThe institutional investors get it all, and retail investors are locked out, forced to either buy into Big Tech equities like Nvidia, or hope that structured products like SPVs deliver something resembling exposure.\n\nEnter Bittensor.\n\nIn February 2024, the decentralized AI network rolled out its Dynamic TAO (dTAO) upgrade, which is aiming to turn staking into something closer to venture capital, where everyone gets a chance to have access to yield.\n\nInstead of passively validating the root subnet, TAO holders now allocate directly to subnets, each with its own on-chain AI startup, and receive “alpha” tokens in return. These tokens reflect the performance and demand of the subnet, and staking decisions determine which projects earn a share of the network’s emissions. It’s a simple market-driven incubator where value is rewarded only if it is created.\n\n\"The subnets form an ecosystem within an ecosystem, where performance and utility are rewarded, stacking opportunities both through staking returns and alpha token appreciation,\" explained ‘Zerobit’, CEO of Talisman, a wallet that’s part of the dTAO ecosystem, during a recent panel on AI at Taiwan Blockchain Week.\n\nTwo subnets illustrate why this matters. Ridges (SN62) is a coding agent that has already outperformed Anthropic’s Claude 4 on SWE-Bench, an industry-standard test of code generation.\n\nIn just weeks, decentralized miners competing for emissions pushed Ridges’ accuracy above 80%, surpassing what a heavily funded centralized tech company delivered with hundreds of millions in capital.\n\nCrucially, it achieved this while spending just tens of thousands of dollars on compute, leveraging Bittensor’s ecosystem of shared subnets and proving the thesis of decentralized AI holds water.\n\nAnother one of those is Chutes (SN64), the network’s serverless compute backbone. Think of it as a decentralized AWS for AI workloads: It processes billions of tokens daily, scales models in seconds, and undercuts centralized providers by up to 85% on cost.\n\nChutes also hosts DeepSeek’s large language models on HuggingFace, making it the largest decentralized provider of open-source inference at scale.\n\nFor retail investors, it could provide a compelling alternative. SPVs offer synthetic claims on private companies, riddled with potential legal and liquidity risk. Subnet staking, by contrast, is permissionless, performance-based, with results that can be verified on-chain.\n\n\"Where most crypto projects lock growth behind insider deals, Bittensor’s dTAO opens investment access from day one, letting them ride the growth in the value of the alpha token,” explained Brad Fuller of Bittensor.ai, a subnet staking data portal, during the same panel at Taiwan Blockchain Week. “It’s an on-ramp for anyone to join the ownership class and share in AI’s growth.”\n\nThe winners attract stake, grow emissions, and compound into stronger projects. With Anthropic and OpenAI still locked away from public markets, Bittensor could be one of the few ways for everyday investors to ride AI’s upside without waiting for Wall Street’s blessing.\n\nWhile TAO may not have the similar pull like flashy Big Tech equities, subnet staking is becoming easier through new wallets, and with heavyweights like DCG’s Barry Silbert circling the ecosystem – who has already called it a protocol as important as bitcoin – this could provide a potential opportunity for those who might go down the rabbit hole of alternative investment options within the AI sector.\n\nBTC: Bitcoin barely budged after the Fed’s quarter-point cut, holding at $116,851 as traders weighed Powell’s risk management framing against a cautious dot plot.\n\nETH: Ethereum saw stronger follow-through, climbing to $4,603.60 with a 6% weekly gain, reflecting renewed appetite for higher-beta names amid expectations of back-to-back cuts in October and December.\n\nGold: Deutsche Bank has lifted its 2026 gold forecast to $4,000/oz., citing strong central bank demand, a weaker dollar, and political uncertainty around the Fed’s independence, after gold’s 41% year-to-date surge past $3,700.\n\nS&P 500: The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% to 6,600.35 after the Fed’s expected rate cut, as Powell signaled it was not the start of an extended easing cycle.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday approved a set of rules for exchanges to list exchange-traded products (ETPs) holding spot commodities, including cryptocurrencies, without requiring the agency’s individual review each time.\n\nThe decision will enable exchanges to proceed with the listing of proposed ETFs by sidestepping the often-lengthy 19(b) rule filing process that can take up to 240 days and requires the SEC to actively approve or disapprove an ETF.\n\nEssentially, the process will be more streamlined than before.\n\nETF Issuers will approach exchanges (Nasdaq, NYSE, CBOE) with a product idea and desire to list their ETF. If the proposed strategy (token or combination of tokens) of the issuers meets the generic listing standard, then the exchange can proceed with listing the ETF.\n\nSEC Chairman Paul Atkins said the decision was aimed at reducing barriers to accessing digital asset products in regulated U.S. marketplaces.\n\n\"By approving these generic listing standards, we are ensuring that our capital markets remain the best place in the world to engage in the cutting-edge innovation of digital assets,\" SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said in a statement.\n\nAlongside the rule change, the agency signed off on the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which tracks the assets in the CoinDesk 5 Index and currently consists of bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,771.52\n, ether\nETH\n$4,537.14\n,\nXRP\n$2.9151\n, Solana\nSOL\n$227.61\nand\nADA\n$0.8415\n.\n\nRead more: SEC's Pause of Grayscale Fund Is Likely Temporary\n\nThe regulator also approved the launch of options tied to the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index and its mini version, broadening the set of crypto-linked derivatives available on regulated U.S. markets.\n\nThe SEC's listing standards could potentially open the way for a wave of spot-based altcoin ETFs that have been waiting for regulators' nod to enter the market.\n\n\"This is the crypto ETP framework we've been waiting for,\" James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an X post. \"Get ready for a wave of spot crypto ETP launches in coming weeks and months.\"\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Kristin Smith, the President of Solana Policy Institute, said, \"We are incredibly encouraged by tonight's news: the SEC continues to promote the rule of law by setting clear rules of the road for US businesses and to take positive steps to allow American investors to safely access digital assets.\"\n\n\"These new generic listing standards are a net-positive for U.S. investors, markets, and digital asset innovation.

    "title": "Tether Co-Founder, Tokenization Pioneer Unveil Startup for GENIUS-Aligned Digital Dollars",
    "content": "Traditional finance has long had a way of splitting capital from coupons, allowing investors to separate interest-payment flows from the principal. Now, a team of stablecoin and blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) pioneers is doing the same for tokenized assets.\n\nA new startup, STBL, emulates TradFi's zero-coupon strip structures by converting digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT). Just as with the traditional equivalent, the components can be held separately, allowing investors to keep the part that appeals to them and sell the other bit to counterparties with different attitudes to risk.\n\nThe product, currently in beta testing, goes beyond just packaging risk into different tranches. It also widens the stablecoin issuance model. With regular stablecoins, like USDT, the issuing company, in this case Tether, keeps the returns on the Treasuries they hold to maintain the token's peg to the dollar. It's profitable business, Tether reported $4.9 billion net profit in the second quarter. With STBL, whoever deposits a tokenized asset into the system becomes the minter and keeps the returns.\n\n“Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” said STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who was also a cofounder of Tether. “For the first time, minters, not issuers, retain the value of reserves. This is the defining shift of Stablecoin 2.0: money that is stable, compliant, and built to serve the community.”\n\nWhen a yield-bearing on-chain asset — this could be any yield-bearing RWA, such as Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, BlackRock’s BUIDL or Ondo’s USDY — is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and serve as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance (DeFi) and a separate, yield-accruing non-fungible token (NFT) called YLD.\n\nThe design is intended to remain a non-security in spirit and align with the U.S. GENIUS Act and other regulatory frameworks by separating principal from yield, said CEO Avtar Sehra, who is also a co-founder of the project and was CEO and founder of Kaio (formerly Libre Capital).\n\n“When a user who’s already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” Sehra said in an interview. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.”\n\nIn the year or so before STBL started up, Sehra and Collins were looking at how RWAs or tokenized securities could be used in DeFi; asking how they worked as collateral; how money market funds became the reserves for minting stablecoins, and so on.\n\nThere had been a view that wrapping an asset, that is taking a tokenized security and placing it into a vault, meant the asset no longer counted as a security as far as U.S. regulations were concerned. But it's not clear that wrapping something \"deviates from or extracts the security-like essence\" of the asset, Sehra said.\n\nTo ensure the USST stablecoin component isn't viewed as a security required a mechanism to maintain the dollar peg. This is achieved by ensuring it is slightly over collateralized coupled with an incentive system related to mint fees and burn credits should deviation happen in a volatile market. Sehra referred to STBL's peg-maintenance system as “synthetic” rather than “algorithmic.”\n\n“The reason I call it a synthetic is because, even though it has this interest-rate algorithmic component to it, it is 103% over collateralized with pure money market assets,” he said. “As a result of this novel structure, eligible participants that hold permitted RWAs can mint and burn compliant stablecoins. So while minters can hold the yield, the stable asset can be openly used without breaking the non-yield bearing requirements of the GENIUS Act. That's exactly how STBL operates.”\n\nThe protocol’s decentralized governance token, also called STBL, has been added to Binance Alpha, Binance Futures and Kraken Spot, and will list on other spot exchanges soon, Sehra said.\n\nThe Sept. 16 debut of the STBL governance token has been lauded as one of the most successful token generating events of 2025, Sehra added. It launched at $100 million fully diluted value, and demand pushed it over $1 billion. It is currently at $1.3 billion, having hit an all time high of about $2.3 billion within 24 hours.\n\nThe next steps involve a $100 million minting using Franklin Templeton’s BENJI token, Sehra said, and also the announcement of several other partnerships, including with a U.S. based payments firm. The protocol is due to open to the public in the fourth quarter.\n\nUPDATE (Sept. 19, 11:46 UTC): Rewrites headline to remove ambiguity.\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

So, implementing a strategy of buying when the crowd is fearful and selling when the crowd gets greedy continues to work extremely well for most altcoins,\" Santiment said on X, explaining BCH's upswing.\n\nThe token's rally aligns with the broader risk-on sentiment sparked by Wednesday's Fed rate cut and market expectations for continued liquidity easing in the coming months. Several tokens, including DOT, SUI, JUP, and NEAR, have seen similar gains in the past 24 hours, while smaller coins like PENGU have led the charge with impressive double-digit increases.\n\nPossibly greasing the Fed-led bullish market sentiment is the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to approve generic listing standards for commodity and crypto ETFs without undergoing individual reviews for each product. This move is expected to speed up the introduction of new products tied to a variety of tokens in the coming months.\n\nBCH’s recent move builds on the bullish breakout confirmed two months ago. In July, its price surged above the upper boundary of a channel pattern formed by trendlines connecting highs from April and December 2024, and lows from August 2024 and April 2025.\n\nThis breakout from a prolonged period of consolidation suggests that selling pressure has been absorbed, clearing the way for further upside.

    "content": "BNB, the token that powers the BNB Chain and can be used for fee discounts on leading exchange Binance, has crossed $1,000 for the first time ever amid a wider crypto market rise.\n\nThe token jumped 4.5% over the last 24-hour period, climbing from $956.80 to a $1,004 all-time high and pushing its market cap to near $140 billion, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.\n\nThat move edged BNB past Solana to reclaim its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nThe rally appears to reflect renewed confidence as Binance is reportedly in talks with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to put an end to a key compliance requirement from the exchange’s 2023 settlement.\n\nBinance has since 2023 been under a court-appointed monitor as part of its $4.3 billion settlement over anti-money transmitting violations.\n\nThe deal, if finalized, would require the exchange to adopt a stricter internal reporting system, as was the case with similar companies that were released from court-appointed monitors.\n\nSome investors on social media are also speculating about the possible return of co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who stepped down as part of Binance’s DOJ settlement. While there is no official indication of his reentry into leadership, the narrative seems to be fueling momentum behind the token.\n\nThe wider crypto market has edged up after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 bps yesterday, as anticipated. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which offers a weighted measured of the broader digital asset market, is around 3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBNB’s upward push began steadily after reports of the Binance-DOJ deal surfaced, with the token trading around $956 in the morning before gathering pace in the evening hours. It jumped from $961.41 to $994.49 in little over an hour, in a spike that came with a surge in trading volume.\n\nThe token found consistent support between $983 and $988, even as it briefly stalled near resistance at $995. That price ceiling was tested multiple times before a final breakout that saw it hit a new all-time high above the psychological barrier of $1,000.\n\nThe sharpest gain came in a six-minute window where prices leapt from $998.74 to $1,004.28, supported by a volume burst eight times above normal hourly levels.\n\nNew resistance is emerging near $1,005, while support has stabilized just below the $1,000 line. BNB’s price has since receded to around $998.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

Assets under management remain above $150 billion, according to SoSoValue data, but the tone in markets shifted after Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized economic uncertainty and signaled fewer cuts ahead than traders had hoped.\n\nAs expected, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a range of 4.00% to 4.25%, in its first cut of the year. But the real surprise came from the central bank's updated projections, which indicated just two more cuts in 2025 and fewer in 2026 than markets had priced in.\n\nIn a cautious press conference, Powell warned of “elevated” inflation and rising “downside risks” to employment, striking a tone that left traders wary. Markets interpreted the move as a hawkish cut, triggering a mild pullback in risk assets.\n\nEthereum ETFs also saw redemptions, with net outflows for a second straight day. Withdrawals amounted to $1.89 million following the exit of $61.7 million the day before.\n\nCryptocurrency prices edged higher.

    "content": "XRP is drawing fresh attention from traditional finance as new products roll out in both securities and derivatives markets, broadening access points for exposure to the token.\n\nAt the time of writing, according to CoinDesk Data, XRP was trading around $3.0263, down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours.\n\nOn Sept. 18, REX Shares and Osprey Funds will debut the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to XRP and\nDOGE\n$0.2601\non the Cboe BZX Exchange, under the tickers XRPR and DOJE. These products are not entirely “pure” spot funds, however.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart wrote on X that the funds aren’t “pure” spot products. Instead, they are structured to hold XRP and DOGE directly, while also investing in other spot ETFs from outside the U.S. to achieve exposure. Their filings also include language that would allow the use of derivatives for exposure if needed, though Seyffart emphasized that this is not the primary approach.\n\nThe structure reflects the realities of building regulated crypto ETFs in the U.S., where sponsors have sometimes layered in indirect exposure. Even so, the launches mark the first time American brokerage accounts will have access to XRP- and DOGE-focused ETFs, expanding beyond bitcoin and ether, which dominate the ETF landscape.\n\nLess than a month later, CME Group plans to deepen its crypto derivatives lineup by listing options on XRP and Solana\nSOL\n$228.11\nfutures, targeted for Oct. 13 pending regulatory review.\n\nOptions will be listed on both the standard contracts and their smaller “micro” versions, designed to serve institutions, trading desks, and active individuals alike. Expiry choices will include every business day, each month, and each quarter, creating a wider term structure for managing exposures.\n\nThe exchange said the decision follows strong growth in its newer altcoin futures.\n\nSince March, SOL futures have logged over 540,000 contracts traded (about $22.3 billion notional), while XRP futures, introduced in May, have seen more than 370,000 contracts change hands (roughly $16.2 billion notional). Market participants including Cumberland and FalconX welcomed the additions, citing the need for hedging tools beyond bitcoin and ether.\n\nHeadquartered in Chicago, CME Group runs the world’s largest regulated derivatives marketplace, where listed crypto futures and options allow participants to hedge positions with central clearing and margining.

    "title": "Arca CIO on Why Crypto’s 2025 Rally Isn’t a True Bull Market and Why Some Tokens Have Outperformed",
    "content": "The chief investment officer of digital asset manager Arca is challenging the idea that 2025 represents a broad-based crypto bull market, arguing that only a handful of large-cap tokens are carrying the industry.\n\nIn an X thread posted Tuesday, Jeff Dorman wrote that “more than 75% of tokens in our coverage universe are negative year-to-date, and more than 50% of tokens are down 40% or more YTD.”\n\nHe added that some of the year’s few gainers have been “complete nonsense coins and memecoins that no serious investor would even look at,” citing\nLTC\n$119.37\nand\nBCH\n$587.03\n.\n\nBy contrast, the best-known names have done relatively well. Bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,777.00\n, ether\nETH\n$4,538.46\n, solana\nSOL\n$228.07\n, binance coin\nBNB\n$1,322.84\nand XRP are all up between 20% and 40% this year, Dorman said.\n\nHe compared the dynamic to traditional finance, where large caps can rally while smaller stocks slump: “This is the TradFi equivalent of the DJIA and GameStop having a good year, while small caps are -40%.”\n\nDorman argued that this dispersion is ultimately healthy. Broad rallies, he said, breed complacency, while uneven performance forces investors to be more selective. “Nothing good comes from an everything rally, because no one learns anything,” he wrote. When weaker projects falter, he added, investors “start to ask questions like ‘how are you doing this?’”\n\nUnlike in past cycles, he said, investors in 2025 cannot simply rely on momentum across altcoins. Instead, they must prioritize projects with tangible business models. “Own stocks and tokens that actually make money & buy back their own tokens with the profits,” Dorman said. “The days of throwing darts to make a fortune are over (i.e. Alt Season isn’t a thing).”\n\nAccording to Dorman, the tokens and companies that have held up in 2025 generally fall into a few categories.\n\nAssets connected to exchange-traded funds or digital asset trusts, such as BTC, ETH and SOL, are leading the way.\n\nCrypto-related equities have also performed well, including Circle, Galaxy Digital, Coinbase and miners like Iris Energy and TeraWulf.\n\nHe also pointed to what he called “U.S. government coins,” namely XRP and Chainlink's LINK token.\n\nFinally, Dormann noted that revenue-generating tokens that distribute value back to holders — among them Hyperliquid's HYPE, Pump.fun's PUMP, Maple Finance’s MPL/SKY — have stood out as relative winners.\n\nEarlier this year, Dorman had floated the idea of a crypto equivalent to the “FAANG” stocks. He suggested an acronym called the “BACHELORS”, naming tokens such as BNB, AERO, CAKE, HYPE, ENA, LEO, OKB, RAY and SKY (MKR). In his Sept. 16 thread, he updated that list to the “BARHEAPs,” incorporating newer projects like PUMP.\n\nFor Dorman, the lesson of 2025 is that crypto’s growth story is more complicated than headline gains might suggest. He argued that calling the year a “bull market” is misleading, since at best it represents a narrow cycle led by a few majors and select revenue-focused projects.\n\n“The reason this has been a hard bull market is because it’s barely even a good year for crypto, let alone a bull market,” he wrote.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "HBAR Retreats Amid Constrained Range Trading and Diminishing Volumes",
    "content": "HBAR spent much of the past 23 hours locked in a narrow range, oscillating between $0.23 and $0.24 in what amounted to just 2% volatility. The token briefly touched session highs at $0.24 on Sept. 16 around 18:00 UTC before sliding lower, ultimately finding repeated support near $0.23. Multiple rebound attempts from that level throughout Sept. 17’s morning trading hinted at a potential price floor, though conviction remained limited.\n\nMarket activity tapered alongside the price drift. Trading volumes fell steadily after an early spike, underscoring weakening participation and suggesting that bullish momentum has largely faded. The constrained range and muted volatility reinforced the impression of indecision, with buyers and sellers unwilling to press for a breakout.\n\nThe final hour of the observed period offered a sharper display of market sentiment. At 13:33 UTC on Sept. 17, HBAR sold off abruptly from $0.24 to $0.23, accompanied by an outsized 2.56 million in volume just three minutes later. Yet the coin staged a measured recovery, climbing back to end near session highs, encapsulating the day’s push and pull between sellers and opportunistic dip buyers.\n\nOverall, HBAR slipped 1% across the 23-hour window. While the establishment of support around $0.23 provides some stability, declining volumes and sustained downward pressure leave the market vulnerable. The swift sell-off and subsequent rebound illustrate the uncertainty still shaping HBAR’s outlook, with bearish sentiment prevailing but tempered by signs of technical resilience.\n\nTechnical Indicators Assessment\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "Democrats in Congress Call Foul on Status of Trump's Crypto Czar David Sacks",
    "content": "President Donald Trump's top adviser on crypto, David Sacks, is working under a \"special government employee\" status that's meant to be for officials serviing an important but temporary duty with the federal government, and Senator Elizabeth Warren penned a letter with other Democrats in Congress asking him whether he's overstepped that window.\n\nSuch an employee isn't allowed to serve more than 130 days in a year, according to the law, and the Wednesday letter to Sacks asks him to put a number on the days the prominent venture capitalist has worked for Trump in the role as crypto and artificial intelligence czar. Under the rules, any day in which he's done work counts against that 130, though in some agencies, the limit has commonly been governed by a \"good faith\" estimate of how long the official expects to serve.\n\n\"If you have worked every business day, your 130th day was July 25, 2025,\" according to the letter signed by Warren and several other members of the Senate and House of Representatives, including Bernie Sanders. The lawmakers called their review of this timeline since the January 20 start of the administration an \"investigation.\"\n\n\"If you have indeed passed the 130th day mark, you are undermining the careful balance Congress struck in creating the SGE designation. It is only because of your designation as an SGE that you have been able to continue working for and being paid by Craft Ventures during your time in government,\" read the letter.\n\nTrump has used the temporary employment status in a high-profile fashion, also employing Tesla CEO Elon Musk in that capacity. The personnel tool is designed to be used to bring expertise into government without having to clear some of the bureaucratic hoops of typical hiring. Earlier this year, other Democrats in Congress pushed a bill that sought to inhibit such employees from using the role to seek financial gain, and Warren also pursued legislation to limit SGEs.\n\nThere have been more than 170 business days since Trump took office. Since then, Sacks has been running the president's aggressive pro-crypto agenda, which has so far celebrated one major new law to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers — leading to a White House signing ceremony that Sacks attended.\n\nHe's also acted as the boss of the administration's day-to-day crypto adviser, which had originally been Bo Hines until he left to work for Tether as its top U.S. executive. Patrick Witt replaced Hines as executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, and he told CoinDesk he's still working closely with Sacks.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Why We Need More Stablecoins",
    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nStablecoins are the real success story in crypto. In the past six years, Stablecoins have quietly become indispensable. Since 2019, people have used stablecoins to move $264.5 trillion across 18 billion in transactions. Why? Stablecoins let you hold money onchain without having to worry about volatility, making them the easiest way to store value and transact in the crypto economy.\n\nTotal market cap of stablecoins is over $280 billion Source: Defillama\n\nWhy are Stablecoins popular right now?\n\nWe’re seeing a rush of companies launching stablecoins in the U.S. because issuers finally gained clarity with the passing of the GENIUS Act in July 2025. For the first time, the U.S. government clearly defined who can issue stablecoins, what counts as a “payment stablecoin,” and what obligations issuers have to consumers.\n\nSince the GENIUS Act passed, MetaMask rolled out mUSD, Stripe launched a payments-focused chain called Tempo, Circle announced their purpose-built stablecoin payments L1, Arc Network, and there’s been a spree of acquisitions. Stablecoin infrastructure companies like Iron are getting snapped up, and traditional finance firms like Stripe are spending heavily to buy crypto companies (Privy and Bridge) whose products they can fold into their existing offerings.\n\nIn addition, chains are launching their own stablecoins as a way to capture more revenue from the yield they generate. MegaETH has its native stablecoin, USDm. Hyperliquid launched USDH, which sparked a bidding war with Paxos, Agora, Sky, and Frax all vying to get involved.\n\nAt this rate, it’s easy to imagine a world where every serious company in crypto eventually issues its own stablecoin. Which raises the obvious question: do we need more?\n\nWhy we need more Stablecoins:\n\n1. Financial inclusion: Even as the number of unbanked people falls, over 1.3 billion remain without access to banking, mostly in places with unstable currencies. Stablecoins provide 24/7 access to money online, without borders. If companies like PayPal push stablecoins directly to existing customers, they could onboard more people to use the global money rails of crypto.\n\n2. Currency diversity: In the real world, we don’t have one currency. We have dollars, euros, yen. The same should be true onchain. If everything settles in dollars, the entire crypto economy becomes dependent on U.S. monetary policy. More stablecoins means less over-reliance on a single standard.\n\n3. Risk mitigation: Right now stablecoin markets are concentrated into the hands of a few big players. With more stablecoins, concentration risk decreases. If one issuer faces technical, regulatory, or solvency issues, users would have alternatives to pivot to without destabilizing the broader ecosystem. More issuers mean more redundancy, making the system safer.\n\nStablecoins are quietly rewriting the rules of global finance. They give anyone, anywhere, access to money that moves instantly, across borders, with incentives aligned to users rather than banks. The more competition, the better. If crypto transforms the global economy, it won’t be because of speculation. It will be because of stablecoins.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nStablecoins: The Revolution in Global Money Transfers\n\nStablecoins are no longer just a bridge between crypto and fiat — they are becoming the rails of global commerce, writes Nonco CEO Fernando Martinez.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.

    "title": "Crypto for Advisors: Crypto Access is Going Mainstream",
    "content": "You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.\n\nInvestor interest in cryptocurrency is on the rise. In this edition of the \"Crypto for Advisors\" newsletter, Sam Boboev breaks down the key stats and analyzes how new app integrations are shaping retail crypto portfolios\n\nThen, Kevin Tam, digital asset research specialist, provides insights into crypto ETF trends, as seen in the recent SEC filings, in \"Ask an Expert.\"\n\nThank you to our sponsor of this week’s newsletter, Grayscale Investments. For financial advisors near San Francisco, Grayscale is hosting Crypto Connect on Thursday, October 9. Learn more.\n\n–S.M.\n\nIn recent years, crypto has moved out of isolated exchanges and into mainstream finance. Major fintech platforms now offer native crypto access. For example, in 2025, Coinbase partnered with Samsung so that Samsung Pay users can fund crypto purchases in-app. Likewise, JPMorgan Chase announced customers will soon be able to link their Chase bank accounts (and even credit-card rewards) directly to Coinbase wallets. PayPal has taken its partnership with Coinbase a step further by deepening its integration around its new USD stablecoin: users can convert dollars to\nPYUSD\n$0.9995\non Coinbase with no platform fees, enabling millions of PayPal accounts to easily on-ramp to crypto. Each move shows that everyday payment and banking apps are weaving crypto into their services – making digital assets as easy to access as cash.\n\nSamsung’s latest software update embodies this trend. Starting in mid-2025, eligible Coinbase users in the U.S. and Canada could use Samsung Pay directly within the Coinbase mobile app. In practice, this means funding a crypto purchase is as simple as tapping at a store checkout: Samsung Wallet (which bundles Samsung Pay) appears as a payment option for your Coinbase account.\n\nOn the banking side, JPMorgan Chase’s July 2025 announcement marked the first time a large bank directly linked customer accounts to a crypto exchange.\n\nBank introduced direct bank-to-wallet linking, rewards-to-crypto, and credit-card funding. These capabilities — all rolled out with enterprise-grade security — provide customers with multiple seamless pathways from their checking accounts and rewards into cryptocurrency.\n\nBig payment platforms are racing in too. In April 2025, PayPal and Coinbase announced an expanded partnership centered on\nPYUSD\n$0.9995\n, PayPal’s dollar-backed stablecoin. Coinbase will let users buy, sell or redeem PYUSD at a 1:1 rate to USD with no exchange fee. In effect, a PayPal user can fund a crypto wallet or be paid in crypto-native USD without touching another fiat service.\n\nThese moves aren’t isolated. Data shows that retail crypto interest is rising. An EY-Parthenon survey (July 2024) found that 64% of retail investors already hold crypto or related digital assets, and 69% plan to increase their digital-asset investments over the next few years. Yet crypto still lags traditional investing: JPMorgan Institute analysis (Aug 2025) reports only about 17% of U.S. households have ever transferred money into crypto (2017–2025), compared to roughly one-third that have bought stocks or bonds in the same period. Adoption is strongly age-skewed: over 20% of Gen Z and Millennial households have invested in crypto, versus just 6% of Baby Boomer households.\n\nTaken together, these data suggest that while crypto remains a niche asset for now, it is gaining a foothold — especially among younger and tech-savvy investors — as it becomes accessible through familiar channels. As fintech giants bring crypto on-ramps into phones and payment apps, many more retail clients will start treating crypto as “just another asset” in their portfolios.\n\nFor financial advisors, the message is clear. Crypto is no longer “some other market” but part of consumers’ everyday finances. According to the EY survey, 72% of digital-asset investors already view crypto as a key component of their wealth-building strategy. Advisors should expect clients to inquire about adding cryptocurrency, stablecoins, or on-chain dollars (such as PYUSD) to their portfolios – and they may require guidance on the amount and through which vehicles.\n\nAt the same time, risks remain. Crypto markets are volatile, and research shows that bitcoin’s price now tends to move in tandem with U.S. stocks. For example, CME Group found Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 has risen from near zero pre-2020 to roughly 0.3–0.4 in recent years (spiking during market stress). This means crypto can amplify portfolio swings in a crash rather than hedge them. Advisors will need to emphasize balanced allocations and ensure clients understand crypto’s boom-and-bust cycles.\n\n- Sam Boboev, founder, Fintech Wrap Up\n\nQ. Where were the largest sources of inflows in Q2 2025?\n\nA. The most significant allocations came from Asia and the Middle East. Hong Kong investment firms contributed more than $1.24 billion combined in bitcoin ETFs. Avenir Group, a family office in HK, holds over $1.01 billion in bitcoin ETFs. While Al Warda Investments disclosed a $147 million position. Al Awada is owned by Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nQ. Who was the largest buyer in Canada?\n\nA. Montreal-based Trans-Canada Capital, which manages Air Canada’s pension assets, disclosed an additional $161 million. This reflects growing institutional confidence in digital assets as a credible alternative investment.\n\nQ. Are there any notable decreases or exits?\n\nA. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board pension fund divested its full $321 million position, largely attributed to profit-taking and rebalancing into bitcoin treasury companies. Millennium Management trimmed back $950 million but remains the largest holder of spot ETF valued $2.4 billion.\n\nFor both corporations and institutional investors, digital assets are becoming strategic allocations, reshaping how capital is diversified and deployed.\n\nSources: SEC filings, Nasdaq, FactSet, Fintel\n\n- Kevin Tam, digital asset research specialist\n\nMore For You\n\nStablecoins: The Revolution in Global Money Transfers\n\nStablecoins are no longer just a bridge between crypto and fiat — they are becoming the rails of global commerce, writes Nonco CEO Fernando Martinez.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.

    "title": "Now is the Time for Active Management in Digital Assets",
    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nThe digital asset market has entered a new phase, one that is more diverse and institutionally engaged than ever before. We are in an era where execution matters more than exposure; where performance hinges not on passive participation, but on how capital is deployed, risk is managed, and alpha is extracted across an increasingly fragmented and complex market.\n\nInnovation is moving faster than index construction. Structural inefficiencies, cross-market dislocations, and credit dynamics are accelerating even as macro conditions remain stable. Recent ETF flows illustrate this shift: in mid-August, U.S. spot ETFs recorded more than $1 billion in a single day of net inflows, led by $640 million into BlackRock’s ETHA and $277 million into Fidelity’s FETH, pushing total ETH ETF assets above $25 billion.\n\nU.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs show similarly active capital rotation, with daily flows swinging between inflows, $614 million on August 8, 2025, and sharp outflows in the days following. Meanwhile, derivatives growth has become a defining feature of market structure with open interest on CME Bitcoin futures hitting a record ~$57 billion, highlighting deeper institutional participation. Crypto derivatives now account for approximately 70-80% of global trading volumes. These movements, alongside the growth of on-chain credit, the derivatives complex and the rise of BTC/ETH-denominated funds, underscore that this is a market defined by tactical allocation and active positioning.\n\nToday’s opportunities demand depth, precision, and a multi-dimensional understanding of both the traditional and digital asset market. The most compelling opportunities are uncovered by managers who can operate seamlessly across centralized and decentralized exchanges, in spot, derivatives, and credit. These are not directional trades riding sentiment; they are high-conviction strategies grounded in an expert understanding of the evolving market structure of digital assets, executed with rigor and speed across fragmented venues.\n\nRecent economic data suggests that risk assets are reaching new highs even in the absence of monetary easing, yet the real story isn’t cyclical, it’s structural.\n\nCrypto credit markets are expanding, with widening spreads between lending and borrowing rates. As BTC and ETH credit markets mature, dispersion in credit quality and spreads is increasing. This creates a differentiated opportunity set where active managers can price risk more effectively than passive exposure, rewarding those with the tools and expertise to capture value. As fiat liquidity tightens and token-native borrowing regains traction, the setup for basis trades, structured strategies, and cross-venue capital deployment strengthens.\n\nMeanwhile, idiosyncratic volatility is re-emerging around protocol upgrades, ETF flows, and regulatory catalysts, favoring familiar hedge fund strategies, including relative value, and volatility arbitrage. These dynamics reward managers who can price complexity, structure trades thoughtfully, and execute with discipline.\n\nInstitutional allocators in 2025 are demonstrating a new level of clarity. Many already hold baseline exposure to capture crypto market beta through ETFs or spot. While these passive products helped legitimize digital assets and broaden access, it is active managers who are generating performance in today’s market. They are building systems designed to deliver value across market regimes, extracting alpha that is uncorrelated to broader digital asset price trends.\n\nMany of the most effective strategies are not new; they have been tested and refined across multiple cycles, drawing on insights from both traditional finance and digital markets. What has changed is the infrastructure, sophistication of the investors, and the breadth of the opportunity set.\n\nThe next phase of digital asset investing belongs to those who treat this space not as a thematic allocation, but as a dynamic alpha-centric market where strategy, speed, and sophistication are decisive.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nStablecoins: The Revolution in Global Money Transfers\n\nStablecoins are no longer just a bridge between crypto and fiat — they are becoming the rails of global commerce, writes Nonco CEO Fernando Martinez.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.

    "content": "XLM rebounded strongly after facing overnight selling pressure, with the token climbing back above $0.39 during European trading hours on Tuesday. The move followed a sharp dip that saw the asset fall from $0.39 at 2 a.m. UTC to $0.38 by 4 a.m., marking the session’s steepest decline. Elevated trading activity around the $0.38 level signaled strong demand, helping to establish that zone as a key support area.\n\nThe bounce gained momentum as markets in Europe opened, pushing XLM back toward $0.39. Analysts noted that the recovery suggested institutional interest, with traders likely accumulating at discounted prices. Price action during the 24-hour window from Sept. 16 at 15:00 UTC to Sept. 17 at 14:00 UTC highlighted resilience, with the asset oscillating within a narrow $0.38–$0.39 band — a 2% swing despite heightened volatility in broader crypto markets.\n\nIntraday trading in the final hour of the observed period reflected this tug-of-war between bulls and bears. After briefly testing $0.39 at 13:25 UTC, XLM slipped back to its session low just 20 minutes later before regaining momentum. The recovery from the dip underscored buying conviction, with the token closing near $0.39 and preserving its bullish structure heading into the U.S. session.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "Layer-1 network Mavryk said it raised $10 million in a strategic investment led by financial derivatives provider MultiBank Group to expand its real-world asset (RWA) tokenization plans.\n\nMavryk Network and MultiBank have an existing partnership to tokenize over $10 billion worth of real estate in the United Arab Emirates through the latter's RWA platform.\n\nThe two companies aim to broaden access to premium investments, such as real estate, according to an emailed announcement on Wednesday.\n\nThe initiative is also supported by major digital asset custody provider Fireblocks, which provides the multiparty computation wallets that safeguard the tokenized assets on Mavryk's network. This allows investors to trade and borrow against their real estate-backed tokens without having to manage their own private keys.\n\nThe funding round follows the $5.2 million raised by its developers, Mavryk Dynamics, in February.\n\nRWAs tokenization refers to representing ownership of real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, as digital tokens that can be bought and sold on blockchains.\n\nAmongst others motivations, one of the proposed advantages of tokenization is generating greater liquidity through expanding access to a larger pool of investors. The idea is that a generally illiquid asset class, such as real estate, could benefit significantly from tokenization.\n\nDeloitte has forecast that the global tokenized real estate market could be worth $4 trillion in 10 year's time.\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Curve Finance Pitches Yield Basis, a $60M Plan to Turn CRV Into an Income Asset",
    "content": "Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov unveiled a proposal on the Curve DAO governance forum that would give the decentralized exchange's token holders a more direct way to earn income.\n\nThe protocol, called Yield Basis, aims to distribute sustainable returns to CRV holders who stake tokens to participate in governance votes, receiving veCRV tokens in exchange. The plan moves beyond the occasional airdrops that have defined the platform's token economy to date.\n\nUnder the proposal, $60 million of Curve's crvUSD stablecoin will be minted before Yield Basis starts up. Funds from selling the tokens will support three bitcoin-focused pools; WBTC, cbBTC and tBTC, each capped at $10 million.\n\nYield Basis will return between 35% and 65% of its value to veCRV holders, while reserving 25% of Yield Basis tokens for the Curve ecosystem. Voting on the proposal runs from Sept. 17 to Sept. 24.\n\nThe protocol is designed to attract institutional and professional traders by offering transparent, sustainable bitcoin yields while avoiding the impermanent loss issues common in automated market makers.\n\nImpermanent loss occurs when the value of assets locked in a liquidity pool changes compared with holding the assets directly, leaving liquidity providers with fewer gains (or greater losses) once they withdraw.\n\nThe new protocol comes against a backdrop of financial turbulence for Egorov himself. The Curve founder has suffered several high-profile liquidations in 2024 tied to leveraged CRV purchases.\n\nIn June, more than $140 million worth of CRV positions were liquidated after Egorov borrowed heavily against the token to support its price. That episode left Curve with $10 million in bad debt.\n\nMost recently, in December, Egorov was liquidated for 918,830 CRV (about $882,000) after the token dropped 12% in a single day. He later said on X that the position was linked to funds from the uWu hack and represented repayment of a promise by uWu’s founder.\n\nCRV rose around 1% in the past 24 hours.\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "The Protocol: ETH Exit Queue Gridlocks As Validators Pile Up",
    "content": "This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nWelcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk.\n\nIn this issue:\n\nETHEREUM VALIDATOR EXIT QUEUE FACES BOTTLENECK: Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system is facing its largest test yet. As of mid-September, roughly 2.5 million ETH — valued at roughly $11.25 billion — is waiting to leave the validator set, according to validator queue dashboards. The backlog pushed exit wait times to more than 46 days on Sept. 14, the longest in Ethereum’s short staking history, dashboards show. The last peak, in August, put the exit queue at 18 days. The initial spark came on Sept. 9, when Kiln, a large infrastructure provider, chose to exit all of its validators as a safety precaution. The move, triggered by recent security incidents including the NPM supply-chain attack and the SwissBorg breach, pushed around 1.6 million ETH into the queue at once. Though unrelated to Ethereum’s staking protocol itself, the hacks rattled confidence enough for Kiln to hit pause, highlighting how events in the broader crypto ecosystem can cascade into Ethereum’s validator dynamics. In a blog post from staking provider Figment, Senior Analyst Benjamin Thalman noted that the current exit queue build up isn’t only about security. After ETH has rallied more than 160% since April, some stakers are simply taking profits. Others, especially institutional players, are shifting their portfolios' exposure. At the same time, the number of validators entering the Ethereum staking ecosystem has been steadily rising. Ethereum’s churn limit, which is a protocol safeguard that caps how many validators can enter or exit over a certain time period, is currently capped at 256 ETH per epoch (about 6.4 minutes), restricting how quickly validators can join or leave the network. The churn limit is meant to keep the network stable. With more than 2.5M ETH lined up, stakers on Sept. 16 face 44 days before even reaching the cooldown step. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nIS L2 DEFI EATING AT ETHEREUM’S L1 DEFI?: Ethereum is in the midst of a paradox. Even as ether hit record highs in late August, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Ethereum’s layer-1 (L1) looks muted compared to its peak in late 2021. Fees collected on mainnet in August were just $44 million, a 44% drop from the prior month. Meanwhile, layer-2 (L2) networks like Arbitrum and Base are booming, with $20 billion and $15 billion in total value locked (TVL) respectively. This divergence raises a crucial question: are L2s cannibalizing Ethereum’s DeFi activity, or is the ecosystem evolving into a multi-layered financial architecture? AJ Warner, the chief strategy officer of Offchain Labs, the developer firm behind layer-2 Arbitrum, argues that the metrics are more nuanced than just layer-2 DeFi chipping at the layer 1.In an interview with CoinDesk, Warner said that focusing solely on TVL misses the point, and that Ethereum is increasingly functioning as crypto’s “global settlement layer,” a foundation for high-value issuance and institutional activity. Products like Franklin Templeton’s tokenized funds or BlackRock’s BUIDL product launch directly on Ethereum L1 — activity that isn’t fully captured in DeFi metrics but underscores Ethereum’s role as the bedrock of crypto finance. Ethereum as a layer-1 blockchain is the secure but relatively slow and expensive base network. Layer-2s are scaling networks built on top of it, designed to handle transactions faster and at a fraction of the cost before ultimately settling back to Ethereum for security. That’s why they’ve become so appealing to traders and builders alike. Metrics like TVL, the amount of crypto deposited in DeFi protocols, highlight this shift as activity is moved to L2s where lower fees and quicker confirmations make everyday DeFi far more practical. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nEF STARTS DECENTRALIZED AI TEAM: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is creating a dedicated artificial intelligence (AI) group to make Ethereum the settlement and coordination layer for what it calls the “machine economy,” according to research scientist Davide Crapis. Crapis, who announced the initiative on X, said the new dAI Team will pursue two priorities: enabling AI agents to pay and coordinate without intermediaries, and building a decentralized AI stack that avoids reliance on a small number of large companies. He said Ethereum’s neutrality, verifiability and censorship resistance make it a natural base layer for intelligent systems. The EF is a non-profit organization based in Zug, Switzerland, that funds and coordinates the development of the Ethereum blockchain. It does not control the network but plays a catalytic role by supporting researchers, developers and ecosystem projects. Its remit includes funding upgrades such as Ethereum 2.0, zero-knowledge proofs and layer-2 scaling, alongside community programs like the Ecosystem Support Program. The foundation also organizes events such as Devcon to foster collaboration and acts as a policy advocate for blockchain adoption. In 2025, EF restructured to handle Ethereum’s growth, emphasizing ecosystem acceleration, founder support and enterprise outreach. The new dAI Team represents a continuation of this shift toward specialized units addressing emerging technologies. — Siamak Masnavi Read more.\n\nAMERICAN EXPRESS DABBLES IN BLOCKCHAIN TRAVEL STAMPS: American Express has introduced Ethereum-based \"travel stamps\" to create a commemorative record of travel experiences. The travel experience tokens, which are technically NFTs (ERC 721 tokens), are minted and stored on Coinbase’s Base network, said Colin Marlowe, vice president of Emerging Partnerships at Amex Digital Labs. The travel stamps, which can be collected anytime a traveler uses their card, are not tradable NTF tokens, Marlowe said, and neither do they function like blockchain-based loyalty points — at least for the time being. “It's a valueless ERC-721, so technically an NFT, but we just didn't brand it as such. We wanted to speak to it in a way that was natural for the travel experience itself, and so we talk about these things as stamps, and they're represented as tokens,” Marlowe said in an interview. “As an identifier and representation of history the stamps could create interesting partnership angles over time. We weren't trying to sell these or sort of generate any like short term revenue. The angle is to make a travel experience with Amex feel really rich, really different, and kind of set it apart,” he said. Fireblocks is also involved, supporting Amex as its Wallet-as-a-Service provider for the passport product, a Fireblocks representative said. The Amex travel app also includes a range of tools for travels and Centurion Lounge upgrades, the company said. – Ian Allison Read more.\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "content": "MoneyGram, the ubiquitous send and receive cash network for retail customers, has made U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and blockchain settlement rails the digital backbone of its revamped mobile app, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nCustomers in the Latin American country of Colombia, where MoneyGram has an extensive retail network of over 6,000 locations, will be the first to use the new app to receive and store stablecoin payments, with plans to expand to additional markets in the near future.\n\nColombia is the ideal launch market, says MoneyGram CEO Anthony Soohoo. It’s a major inbound remittance corridor where families receive more than 22 times the money they send abroad, and where the Colombian peso has lost over 40% of its value over the past four years.\n\nWhen it comes to the advancement of stablecoins, Soohoo compares this to other killer apps such as the humble spreadsheet, which drove adoption in the early PC era, or what the browser did for the Internet, or GPS and mobile phones.\n\n“Stablecoins really are the killer app for crypto and I think we're just at the dawn of all the possibilities,” Soohoo said in an interview. “Our customers are able to hold and store a currency that is stable and allows for real time settlement. And with the GENIUS Act passed in the US, we now have a framework in terms of how it's going to be regulated and how we can work with it.”\n\nUnder the hood, the new MoneyGram app is powered by Circle’s USDC stablecoin and Stellar, the fast and cheap blockchain, as well as Crossmint, a wallet infrastructure and stablecoin payments platform.\n\nStepping back, MoneyGram has close to half a million locations where customers can pick up cash or send money, Soohoo said. As a remittance provider, it services over 20,000 corridors around the world. MoneyGram also happens to be the largest cash on and off ramp for crypto, Soohoo added.\n\n“When you talk about global payments there are a lot of companies that may have a presence and a strong brand in one market but when you leave the U.S., or the U.K., for example, no one knows about them,” Soohoo said. “We've been around for many years now and our brand is truly global.”\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The price of BNB rose nearly 3% over the last 24 hours after Bloomberg reported that Binance is moving toward a potential deal that would end a a key compliance requirement from the exchange’s 2023 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nBNB, which offers discounted trading fees on the exchange, was recently trading near $950 after failing to decisively push through it on a rally that started after the report was published. The court-appointed monitor was appointed as part of Binance's $4.3 billion settlement over anti-money transmitting violations.\n\nThe move would follow a growing trend inside the DOJ, which has already released at least three other firms, including an arm of U.K. lender Natwest Group and shipbuilder Austin, from similar oversight after they agreed to enhanced reporting requirements.\n\nIf finalized, the deal would likely require Binance to adopt stricter internal reporting systems. The DOJ has not made a final decision, according to Bloomberg, and the Treasury Department's own monitor over Binance would remain in place for now, the report adds.\n\nBNB’s price rose as high as $963 in today’s trading session, its highest level in months, before settling back. Trading volumes also spiked.\n\nThe rise allowed BNB to outperform the wider crypto market, which has been treading water ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision due later Wednesday .

    "title": "Bullish Shares Rise 5% Ahead of Earnings After Crypto Exchange Secures New York BitLicense",
    "content": "Shares of Bullish (BLSH) rose 5% to $53.12 on Tuesday after the crypto platform secured a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services, a crucial regulatory approval that opens the door to offering spot trading and custody services to institutional clients in New York.\n\nWith the license, Bullish’s U.S. arm — Bullish US Operations LLC — can now legally serve advanced traders in the financial capital of the U.S., an important step in the company’s push to expand domestically. Until now, Bullish was only regulated in Germany, Hong Kong and Gibraltar. Bullish's global parent is also CoinDesk's parent company.\n\nThe license comes just a day after Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest significantly increased its exposure to the company. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) acquired 120,609 shares while ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) picked up 40,574 shares, together worth about $8.21 million.\n\nBullish, which runs a trading platform aimed at institutional investors, will report second-quarter earnings after markets close on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this week, investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) initiated coverage on the company with a \"market perform\" rating and a $55 price target. The firm called Bullish “a rare public play” on a crypto exchange built for institutions and noted that its entry into the U.S. could drive growth. KBW sees domestic expansion as a key catalyst.\n\nBullish debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in August through a direct listing. Its stock surged to $104 on opening day before closing at $68. Since then, shares have fallen 22%, with today’s BitLicense announcement providing a boost.\n\nIf Bullish succeeds in expanding its footprint in the U.S., it could emerge as a legitimate competitor to Coinbase, according to brokerage firm Bernstein. The firm said success will depend on the platform’s ability to execute on its U.S. launch plans, currently targeted for 2026, Bernstein said.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bitcoin traded at $116,236 as of 14:04 UTC on Sept. 17, up about 1% in the past 24 hours, holding above a key level as markets await the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement.\n\nDean Crypto Trades noted on X that bitcoin is only about 7% above its post-election local peak, while the S&P 500 has risen 9% and gold has surged 36% during the same period. He said bitcoin has compressed more than those assets, making it likely to lead the next larger move, though it could form a “lower high” before extending further. He added that ether could join in once it breaks $5,000 and enters price discovery.\n\nLark Davis pointed to bitcoin’s history around September FOMC meetings, saying every September decision since 2020 — except during the 2022 bear market — has preceded a strong rally. He stressed that the pattern is less about the Fed’s rate choice itself and more about seasonal dynamics, arguing that bitcoin tends to thrive in this period heading into “Uptober.”\n\nAccording to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, bitcoin rose about 0.9% during the Sept. 16–17 analysis window, climbing from $115,461 to $116,520. BTC reached a session high of $117,317 at 07:00 UTC on Sept. 17 before consolidating.\n\nFollowing that peak, bitcoin tested the $116,400–$116,600 range multiple times, confirming it as a short-term support zone. In the final hour of the session, between 11:39 and 12:38 UTC, BTC attempted a breakout: prices moved narrowly between $116,351 and $116,376 before spiking to $116,551 at 12:34 on higher volume. This confirmed a consolidation-breakout pattern, though the gains were modest.\n\nOverall, bitcoin remains firm above $116,000, with support around $116,400 and resistance near $117,300.\n\nThe latest 24-hour CoinDesk Data chart, ending 14:04 UTC on Sept. 17, shows BTC at $116,236 after retreating from intraday highs near $117,295. The price has consolidated in the $116,000–$116,500 band, underscoring short-term support.\n\nThe one-month chart shows bitcoin climbing from lows near $108,000 in late August to recent highs above $117,000. The trend remains upward, though the past few sessions show consolidation, suggesting the market is pausing before its next move.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Galaxy Digital (GLXY), the digital asset investment firm led by Mike Novogratz, is planning to release a tokenized money-market fund, according to two people familiar with the plan.\n\nThe New York City-based company is aiming to bring a more crypto-native twist to the range of traditional finance-led tokenized fund offerings, such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI token, said the people, who declined to be identified.\n\nThe Galaxy fund, which will debut in the coming months, will ultimately be available on the Ethereum, Solana and Stellar blockchains. That said, it won't appear on all three blockchains on day one, according to one of the people. Anchorage Digital is to be the custodian of the new fund.\n\n“The overarching ambition is to use the power of tokenization to offer instant liquidity, and there’s a lot of innovation around that to come,” the person said. “Galaxy has had the benefit of seeing BUIDL and some of the other ones out there in the market, and seeing who's engaging with these funds, how they're engaging with them, and how that could be better.”\n\nA representative for Galaxy Digital declined to comment on the fund.

ARAY offers exposure to Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium’s token.\n\nBoth ETPs are token-backed and trade on major European exchanges.

    "title": "Ethereum Faces Validator Bottleneck With 2.5M ETH Awaiting Exit",
    "content": "Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system is facing its largest test yet. As of mid-September, roughly 2.5 million ETH — valued at roughly $11.25 billion — is waiting to leave the validator set, according to validator queue dashboards.\n\nThe backlog pushed exit wait times to more than 46 days on Monday, the longest in Ethereum’s short staking history, dashboards show. The last peak, in August, put the exit queue at 18 days.\n\nThe initial spark came on Sept. 9, when Kiln, a large infrastructure provider, chose to exit all of its validators as a safety precaution. The move, triggered by recent security incidents including the NPM supply-chain attack and the SwissBorg breach, pushed around 1.6 million ETH into the queue at once. Though unrelated to Ethereum’s staking protocol itself, the hacks rattled confidence enough for Kiln to hit pause, highlighting how events in the broader crypto ecosystem can cascade into Ethereum’s validator dynamics.\n\nIn a blog post from staking provider Figment, Senior Analyst Benjamin Thalman noted that the current exit queue build up isn’t only about security. After ETH has rallied more than 160% since April, some stakers are simply taking profits. Others, especially institutional players, are shifting their portfolios exposure.\n\nAt the same time, validators entering the Ethereum staking ecosystem have been steadily rising. The SEC’s May statement clarifying that staking is not a security has renewed interests in staking. Anticipation of ETH ETF approvals is another driver, as funds prepare for regulated ways to capture staking yield, Thalman noted.\n\nEthereum’s churn limit, which is a protocol safeguard that caps how many validators can enter or exit over a certain time period, is currently capped at 256 ETH per epoch (about 6.4 minutes), restricting how quickly validators can join or leave the network, and is meant to keep the network stable.\n\nWith more than 2.5M ETH lined up, stakers on Wednesday face 44 days before even reaching the cooldown step.\n\nThalman believes that much of the ETH existing will simply be restaked under new validators, meaning that if even 75% of the current queue is re-deposited, nearly 2 million ETH will flood the activation queue, bringing delays for new ETH staking, and a backlog on both sides of the validator queue.\n\n“The activation queue is currently 13 days, to this add the ~2M ETH from those currently exiting (35 days) and 4.7M from ETFs (81 days), and the total is 129 days. This assumes that there are no other ETH holders that choose to stake and enter the queue, like corporate treasuries,” Thalman wrote in the blog.\n\nThe swelling queue underscores a paradox: Ethereum is working \"as intended” Thalman notes, and the demand to both exit and re-enter highlights staking’s central role in the ecosystem. The network is thus experiencing the growing pains of a maturing, institutionalized system where infrastructure scares, profit cycles, and regulatory shifts all collide in real time.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Staking Queue Overtakes Exits as Fears of a Sell-off Subside\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "title": "Asia Morning Briefing: BTC Traders Brace for Fed Cuts but Massive $4.5B Liquidity Tests Loom",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nPolymarket and CME FedWatch are aligned: the Fed’s easing cycle begins tomorrow. Both have a 25 bps cut locked in for the next FOMC meeting, with odds building for a three-cut path through year-end.\n\nPolymarket traders leave more room for aggressive easing, while CME assigns steadier probabilities of 25 bps steps. Either way, markets see 75 bps in cuts as the baseline for 2025.\n\nMarket conviction around the Fed pivot is already showing up on-chain, with BTC trading at $116,762, up 1.3% on the day and 4.7% on the week, while ETH sits at $4,502, up 4.3% on the week as traders price in the cuts.\n\nNow, some traders are sitting on the sidelines to see just how the market might react as the Fed announces cuts.\n\nIn a recent report, CryptoQuant data shows bitcoin exchange inflows have dropped to a 7-day average of just 25,000 BTC, the lowest in more than a year and a half; the level seen in mid-July when BTC first crossed $120,000. The average BTC deposit size has also halved to 0.57 BTC, evidence that large holders are sitting idle rather than rushing to sell.\n\nETH is seeing the same pattern: exchange inflows have fallen to a two-month low of 783,000 ETH, down sharply from 1.8 million in August. The average ETH deposit has declined to 30 ETH from 40–45 ETH earlier this summer, suggesting reduced sell-side activity from whales.\n\nIf BTC and ETH are being hoarded, stablecoins are flowing in CryptoQuant writes in its report. USDT deposits into exchanges surged to $379 million at the end of August, the highest this year, and remain elevated at $200 million. The average daily USDT deposit has doubled since July, giving exchanges the “dry powder” needed to support a post-Fed rally.\n\nBut the flows aren’t uniform. Altcoins are seeing a resurgence of exchange activity, with transaction deposits climbing to a 7-day total of 55,000, up from a flat 20,000–30,000 range earlier this year. That divergence signals possible profit-taking in higher-beta names even as BTC and ETH supply remains tight.\n\n\"September brings a wave of token unlocks totaling $4.5 billion, a dynamic that could pressure liquidity and test market absorption,\" OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin wrote in a note to CoinDesk.\n\nTrue opportunity lies beyond short-term volatility, Lin argued.\n\n\"Stablecoins are nearing $300 billion in supply, token unlocks are putting market depth to the test, and major infrastructure upgrades like Nasdaq’s move toward tokenized securities are signaling that crypto is becoming part of the global financial system, not an outlier,\" she wrote.\n\nThe message is clear: the Fed pivot is nearly priced in. What matters now is whether crypto’s liquidity buffers, stablecoins, exchange inflows, and token unlocks can absorb the shocks and channel capital into the next leg higher for BTC.\n\nBTC: BTC is trading above $116,500 as traders are optimistic about potential U.S. interest rate cuts. Technical factors such as the closing of futures gaps have added upward pressure. Some caution is setting in ahead of the Fed meeting.\n\nETH: ETH is trading with modest strength, supported by overall crypto market momentum (dominated by BTC), but with some resistance as investors weigh macro risks and await clarity on policy from the Fed.\n\nGold: Gold is hitting record highs, driven by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates, a weakening U.S. dollar, and heightened geopolitical or macroeconomic uncertainty. Safe‑haven demand from investors is strong.\n\nNikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks fell on Wednesday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.3%, as investors tracked Wall Street losses and awaited a likely Fed rate cut decision.\n\nS&P 500: The S&P 500 slipped 0.13% to 6,606.76 Tuesday as investors booked profits ahead of the Fed’s rate decision after touching a record high earlier.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Stellar’s XLM token saw sharp volatility over the past 23 hours, swinging between $0.38 and $0.39 in a tight but active trading range. The token’s most explosive move came between 08:00–09:00 UTC, when XLM spiked from $0.38 to $0.39 on surging volume of 70 million—more than triple its 24-hour average.\n\nTrading momentum carried through the following hour, with volume staying elevated above 60 million before the price consolidated near the upper band of the range.\n\nThe morning rally was fueled by a mix of technical activity and strengthening fundamentals. Notably, a recent DTCC patent filing referenced both XRP and XLM as compatible networks for liquidity tokenization within systems that handle nearly $4 quadrillion in securities annually.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stellar Development Foundation said major payments and asset management firms are preparing to launch on the network in the coming weeks, a development coinciding with a ninefold increase in Stellar’s total value locked over the past year.\n\nBut bullish momentum quickly evaporated in the final session. Between 13:15 and 14:14 UTC, XLM slipped back from $0.39, erasing morning gains.\n\nThe sharpest selling hit around 13:45–13:47, when the token tumbled on heavy volume above 3.6 million. Activity slowed to zero in the last two minutes of trading, suggesting an institutional step back and potential short-term consolidation.\n\nThe whipsaw highlights crypto’s vulnerability to fast-shifting sentiment, even as institutional interest grows.\n\nXLM’s morning breakout underscored enthusiasm around Stellar’s expanding ecosystem and validation from a critical financial market infrastructure player. Yet the intraday reversal reinforced how quickly optimism can give way to profit-taking, leaving traders cautious about near-term direction.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "Bitcoin Traders Should Pay Attention to Japan as Top Economist Warns of Debt Implosion",
    "content": "While much of the attention from the crypto and traditional markets remains on the U.S., a recent analysis by a leading economist suggests it’s time to look east.\n\nJapan is teetering on the edge of a debt crisis, but a potential recession in the U.S. could provide the land of the rising sun a temporary window of relief, according to Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution.\n\nFor years, Japan has held the highest public debt-to-GDP ratio among advanced economies, consistently hovering above 200%. However, in the post-COVID era marked by massive fiscal spending, investors' tolerance for such high debt levels has waned.\n\nTo complicate matters, Japan's inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), has surged since mid-2022, bringing inflation rates up to levels not seen since the 1980s. The trend is consistent with the sticky price pressures worldwide.\n\nThe elevated inflation has pushed government bond yields higher and increased the cost of additional fiscal borrowing. These combined pressures have thrust Japan’s staggering debt-to-GDP ratio of around 240% into the spotlight, effectively boxing the government into a difficult position.\n\nBrooks put it best in his latest Substack post: \"The bottom line is that exceptionally high government debt is putting Japan in a terrible bind. If Japan sticks with low interest rates, it risks further Yen depreciation, which could cause inflation to run out of control. If it anchors the Yen by allowing yields to rise further, this could put Japan’s debt sustainability at risk.\"\n\n\"This catch-22 means a debt crisis is much closer than people think,\" he added.\n\nGrowing debt concerns could drive investors to alternative financial escape valves such as cryptocurrencies, mainly stablecoins. Japanese startup JPYC is planning to issue the first stablecoin pegged to the yen later this year.\n\nThe yen has appreciated by nearly 7% to 146.50 per U.S. dollar this year as expectations for Fed rate cuts have led to a broad-based dollar sell-off.\n\nHowever, zooming out tells an entirely different story. Since 2021, the yen has depreciated by a solid 41%, adding to domestic inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, the 10-year Japanese bond yield surged to 1.60% from nearly zero in 2020, reaching its highest level since 2008. The 30-year yield has also hit multi-decade highs. In other words, investors are demanding a higher premium to lend money to the government to compensate for the growing fiscal risks.\n\nJapan may find some relief in a potential U.S. recession, marked by consecutive quarterly contractions in the GDP. Such a situation would see investors worldwide park money in government bonds, driving yields lower. (Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions).\n\nThe resulting drop in Japanese yields could then buy time for Japan, according to Brooks.\n\n\"It’s possible that the U.S. goes into recession, which will cause U.S. and global yields to fall. That will buy Japan time. But - in the end - the only sustainable way out of this catch-22 is for Japan to cut spending and/or raise taxes,\" Brooks noted.\n\nStill, the big question remains: will Japanese citizens accept higher taxes and spending cuts? Only time will tell.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bullish (BLSH), the parent company of CoinDesk, has secured a coveted BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a key regulatory approval that will allow the institutional digital asset platform to offer spot trading and custody services to customers in New York, the company said in a press release on Wednesday.\n\nThe BitLicense, also known as a Virtual Currency Business Activity License, is considered one of the most rigorous state-level crypto approvals in the U.S.\n\nWith it, Bullish’s U.S. entity, Bullish US Operations LLC, can now cater to institutional clients and advanced traders in the country’s financial capital.\n\n“New York is widely recognized as being at the forefront of virtual currency regulation,” said Tom Farley, CEO of Bullish, in the release.\n\n“Receiving our BitLicense and Money Transmission License from the New York Department of Financial Services is a testament to Bullish’s commitment to regulatory compliance and our dedication to building trusted, institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure in key global markets,” he added.\n\nThe license win follows the firm's successful initial public offering in August. It marks the second crypto exchange, after Coinbase (COIN), to go public in the U.S.\n\nBullish is also among several crypto-native companies that have recently gone public under the Trump administration's more digital asset-friendly regulatory approach. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) and exchange Gemini (GEMI) also recently IPO'd.\n\nChris Tyrer, president of Bullish Exchange, called the approval “a significant regulatory milestone” and said it strengthens the company’s credibility with institutions. “We believe that clear regulation drives responsible market evolution and institutional engagement,” Tyrer said in the release.\n\nThe milestone adds to Bullish’s growing list of regulatory credentials.\n\nThe exchange is now regulated in the U.S., Germany, Hong Kong and Gibraltar, and positions itself as a venue designed for institutional-grade liquidity, combining a central limit order book with automated market making.\n\nThe BitLicense clears the path for the crypto platform to expand in the U.S., which Wall Street analysts noted as a key catalyst for the stock.\n\nInvestment bank Canaccord said that with Bullish licensed in Europe and Asia, securing a BitLicense would open access to U.S. institutional clients.\n\nMeanwhile, broker Bernstein said that Bullish could compete with rivals such as Coinbase if the platform successfully launches in the U.S. in 2026. \"We expect Bullish to capture ~8% market share in U.S. spot institutional crypto volumes by 2027E, while global spot market share remains at ~7%,\" Bernstein's analysts wrote.\n\nInvestment bank KBW also said near-term U.S. expansion was a catalyst for growth for Bullish, and the firm's differentiated tech stack, competitive fees and deep liquidity positioning it to gain market share.\n\nRead more: Bullish Gets a New $55 Price Target from KBW With U.S. Entry Seen as Key Catalyst\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nGlobal markets are treading water as investors wait on the Federal Reserve’s latest policy move, coming later today. It’s almost a given the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Traders will instead focus on Chair Jerome Powell for signs on future policy.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is no different. Over the last 24 hours, the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index is practically unchanged, up just 0.2%, while bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,791.65\nis around 1% higher. Gold, which surged to a record $3,700 this week, slipped 0.5%. The U.S. dollar index added less than 0.2%.\n\nEquities markets have barely moved as well. U.S. stocks slipped in yesterday’s session, while European equities are edging higher. The FTSE All-World Index advanced less than 0.1% today.\n\nThat's today. But over a longer period, cryptocurrencies have lagged behind equities.\n\nIn the last 30 days, the FTSE All-World Index rose 2.78%, while the CoinDesk 20 added 2.6% and BTC gained 1.6%. The moves suggest caution even ahead of rate cut that would boost the appeal of risk assets.\n\nInvestors are currently pricing in six interest rate cuts. Three this year, and three next year.\n\n“Market expectations are positioned in a Goldilocks range: six cuts represent a middle ground between caution and aggression,” analysts at QCP Capital wrote in a note.\n\n“A deviation in the dot plot, however, would challenge that balance, forcing investors to recalibrate around the risk of tighter-than-expected conditions or a Fed struggling to respond effectively to weaker growth,” the analysts added.\n\nMarkets' real test will be Powell’s press conference. A balanced message is likely to further support risk assets, while hesitation would force investors to reassess.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, demand for spot crypto ETFs has remained robust. This week, net inflows for spot BTC ETFs are around $550 million, while spot ether ETFs brought in nearly $300 million.

However, institutional investors are seizing the opportunity, snapping up 680 million DOGE tokens amid the price dip.\n\nThis flurry of accumulation comes as regulatory clarity improves ahead of the anticipated approval of the first U.S.-listed spot Dogecoin ETF, according to CD Analytics.\n\nOn Tuesday, CleanCore Solutions announced the purchase of an additional 100 million DOGE, bringing its treasury holdings to over 600 million DOGE.\n\nThe Rex Shares-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) is expected to go live this week, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without needing to own and store it.\n\nThe Binance-listed dogecoin-bitcoin ratio (DOBE/BTC) could see sharp gains, assuming the Fed cuts rates as expected on Wednesday, while laying the groundwork for aggressive easing over the coming months.\n\nThat's because the DOGE-BTC ratio has carved out a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. In other words, the stage is set for an outsized DOGE rally relative to BTC.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 4% later on Wednesday. With traders pricing in a 99% chance of this move, it’s essentially baked into the market.\n\nThat means the focus now shifts to what the Fed signals about future cuts.

    "content": "Google is taking a step toward merging artificial intelligence (AI) and digital money, rolling out a new open-source protocol that lets AI applications send and receive payments, which includes support for stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, according to a press release.\n\nTo incorporate stablecoin rails, Google teamed up with U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase, which has been developing its own AI-integrated payments infrastructure.\n\nThe company also worked with the Ethereum Foundation and coordinated with more than 60 other organizations, including Salesforce, American Express, and Etsy, to cover traditional finance use cases.\n\nThe move builds on Google’s earlier work to establish a standard for “AI agents.” These digital agents may eventually handle complex tasks, such as negotiating mortgages or shopping for clothes, without direct human input.\n\nIn April, Google rolled out a protocol to standardize agent-to-agent communication. The latest update extends that framework into financial transactions, aiming to ensure payments are secure, interoperable, and executed with the human user’s intent in mind.\n\nGoogle’s experiment demonstrates a growing trend of activity across the stablecoin market. USDC-issuer Circle's oversubscribed IPO indicated investor appetite earlier this year, with some suggesting that stablecoins are a \"monetary revolution in the making.\"\n\nData from DefiLlama shows $289 billion worth of stablecoins are in circulation, a jump from $205 billion at the turn of the year.\n\nMore For You\n\nSquare Launches Bitcoin Payment Tools for Small Businesses\n\nThe features allow U.S. sellers to accept BTC, convert fiat sales automatically and manage crypto alongside traditional finances.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Square Launches Bitcoin Payment Tools for Small Businesses",
    "content": "Square, the payment services arm of Block (XYZ), has launched a new set of tools aimed at making bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,695.61\neasier to use for small businesses, letting sellers accept crypto payments and manage their digital assets alongside traditional finances, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nThe offering, called Square Bitcoin, includes three main features: bitcoin payments, automatic bitcoin conversions from card sales, and a native bitcoin wallet built into Square’s seller platform. Sellers will be able to accept bitcoin with no processing fees for the first year and choose to convert up to 50% of their daily sales into bitcoin automatically. The tools are available to eligible U.S. businesses, with bitcoin payments rolling out November 10.\n\nThe announcement reflects a broader trend. Crypto payments in the U.S. are expected to grow 82% between 2024 and 2026, according to data cited in the release. But so far, access to bitcoin has mostly focused on investors or tech-savvy individuals. Square’s move aims to bring that access to Main Street.\n\nIn practice, the tools could let a local coffee shop accept a bitcoin payment from a customer using a phone wallet, convert half their day’s sales into bitcoin automatically, and review all their finances in the same dashboard they use to manage inventory and payroll. According to Square, 142 bitcoin have already been accumulated through early use of the conversion feature, first piloted in 2024.\n\nBy folding bitcoin into its existing payments and banking ecosystem, Square — a subsidiary of Block (SQ) — is trying to lower the barrier to entry for small businesses to participate in the crypto economy. It’s also a continuation of Block’s long-running focus on bitcoin, which spans retail tools like Cash App and hardware initiatives like its Bitkey wallet and Proto mining products.\n\nMiles Suter, head of bitcoin product at Block, said the tools are designed to help sellers “never miss a sale” while giving them access to financial tools that have typically been out of reach.\n\n“We’re making bitcoin payments as seamless as card payments,” he said in a statement.\n\nMore For You\n\nHyperliquid Lists MON-USD Perpetuals Ahead of Hotly Anticipated Monad Airdrop\n\nBoth Hyperliquid’s announcement and Monad’s recent posts suggest that an airdrop may be imminent.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "The GENIUS Act Is Already Law. Banks Shouldn't Try to Rewrite It Now",
    "content": "Healthy competition drives innovation and better products for consumers; it is at the center of American economic leadership. Unfortunately, now that the bipartisan GENIUS Act has been signed into law, major legacy financial institutions seem to be having second thoughts about the innovations that stablecoins can bring to financial markets. Bank lobbying groups and public affairs teams have been peppering Congress with complaints about the law, urging members to reopen debate and introduce changes to the legislation that will ensure the stablecoin market doesn’t grow too quickly, protecting banks’ profits and stifling consumer choice.\n\nThis reactionary response is both overblown and unnecessary. What legacy financial firms should do instead is embrace competition and offer exciting new products and services that consumers want, not try to kneecap emerging players through anti-innovation rules and regulations.\n\nThe GENIUS Act was carefully designed with a thorough bipartisan process to strengthen consumer safeguards, ensure regulatory oversight, and preserve financial stability. Efforts to roll back its provisions are less about protecting families and more about protecting entrenched banking interests from the competition that helps ensure the U.S. banking system stays the strongest and most innovative in the world.\n\nCritics warn that allowing stablecoins to provide rewards could lead to massive deposit outflows from community banks, with figures as high as $6.6 trillion cited. But closer examination shows this fear is unfounded. A July 2025 analysis by consulting firm Charles River Associates found no statistically significant relationship between stablecoin adoption and community bank deposit outflows. In fact, the overwhelming majority of stablecoin reserves remain in the traditional financial system — either in commercial bank accounts or in short-term Treasuries — where they continue to support liquidity and credit in the broader U.S. economy. The dire estimates rely on unrealistic assumptions that every dollar of stablecoin issuance permanently leaves the banking system.\n\nStablecoins are not siphoning resources away from lending. If anything, their growth may increase inflows to the U.S. money supply over time, according to a Treasury Department report. That means Americans can benefit from modern, programmable digital dollars without threatening the availability of credit in their communities.\n\nOthers have urged the repeal of Section 16(d) of the GENIUS Act, which allows subsidiaries of state-chartered institutions to effect stablecoin business across state lines without needing additional licenses. If this important part of GENIUS is repealed, the result would be a fragmented, Balkanized and ineffective regulatory regime that stifles interstate commerce.\n\nInnovation has always been the lifeblood of American capitalism — it’s what separates dynamic market economies from stagnant, protected ones. Rather than trying to box out new market entrants, banks should be working to ensure their current and future customers have access to cutting-edge products and services, including healthier interest rates on deposit accounts.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve’s target rate today is above 4%, the average checking account yields just 0.07% and savings accounts 0.39%. That gap doesn’t reflect consumer protection; it reflects value captured by banks. Stablecoin rewards programs, by contrast, allow platforms to compete head-to-head for customers in ways that force incumbents to offer better value. Consumers win when competition exists.\n\nThe GENIUS Act positions the U.S. as the global leader in digital finance while maintaining the strongest consumer protections. Congress already debated and settled these issues through careful bipartisan deliberation. The law requires one-to-one reserves in cash or Treasuries, robust licensing and supervision, and transparency far beyond what is expected of traditional deposits. Relitigating these questions now would undermine that consensus and threaten to slow America's leadership in digital finance.\n\nStablecoins do not represent a loophole, they represent an innovation that preserves the stability of the banking system while giving consumers the benefit of competition. Policymakers should see through this fear campaign and stand by the balanced, bipartisan framework Congress already enacted.\n\nInnovation and competition built American financial leadership. It's time to let it work again — and not allow incumbent interests to stifle its promising growth. American consumers deserve nothing less.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "The Clock Is Ticking on Crypto Market Structure Legislation in the U.S.",
    "content": "With the enactment of the GENIUS Act and passage of the CLARITY Act through the U.S. House of Representatives, the United States has reversed its hostile approach to the digital asset ecosystem. While the Biden Administration spent the past four years injecting uncertainty for digital asset users and innovators, other countries pursued different approaches. This reality was apparent as I traveled with bipartisan members of the House Committee on Financial Services and House Committee on Agriculture to Latin America and Europe for a series of digital asset oversight meetings.\n\nDuring our discussions with both the private sector and government policy leaders, I had the opportunity to see firsthand how digital assets are being used and evolving globally. The takeaway is clear: Latin America, Europe and the U.S. each represent a distinct path in the development of digital asset markets — and together highlight why the U.S. must enact a regulatory framework for the digital asset markets.\n\nAcross Latin America, we saw firsthand digital asset use cases in the real economy. In South and Central America, people are driving grassroots use of digital assets at scale for payments, remittances and savings. Last year, digital asset markets in the region were valued at $415 billion, with 46% of investment flowing primarily into U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins.\n\nArgentina stands out as a digital assets pioneer in Latin America with stablecoins providing an inflation-resistant store of value as the Milei Administration begins to formalize their approach to a regulatory framework for digital assets. Paraguay’s hydropower has made it a hub for Bitcoin mining, while Mexico is advancing fintech and crypto oversight alongside strong consumer demand. Moreover, Peru has incorporated digital asset exchanges into its anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing regime and signaled plans to integrate digital assets into its national tax framework. In short, Latin America underscores compelling use cases of digital assets: resilience against inflation, low-cost transfers and financial inclusion.\n\nOur members also met with European Central Bankers, financial regulators and private sector innovators. In 2023, the European Union (EU) passed the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) into law which created a comprehensive regulatory framework around the digital asset ecosystem. MiCA seeks to set the rules of the road for e-money tokens, asset-referenced tokens, service providers and stablecoin issuers across the entirety of the EU. The EU’s market regulator, ESMA, and the European Banking Authority coordinate with EU member states to ensure that digital asset regulation is harmonized.\n\nGiven that the EU had a head start implementing their digital asset rules and regulations, it was insightful to hear their experience in crafting these regulations as the U.S. is beginning a similar endeavor. In our discussions with European digital asset firms, it was clear that implementation is critical to ensuring a functional framework for the digital asset ecosystem. We must ensure that the regulations do not crowd out small innovative firms, creating a landscape where only large institutions are able to successfully comply within the legal framework.\n\nAlthough the U.S. has the deepest liquidity in digital asset markets and is home to some of the largest issuers and exchanges, we still lack a comprehensive market structure for digital assets. The GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025, was the United States’ first step in providing regulatory clarity for digital assets. By enacting a framework for payment stablecoin issuance, the GENIUS Act will drive the creation of a modern, digital payments system in the United States.\n\nThis is only one piece of the puzzle, however. Without a market structure framework that allows innovation while protecting consumers and investors, the U.S. digital asset ecosystem will not thrive, and we risk ceding ground to Latin America’s fast-moving adoption and Europe’s harmonized regulatory regime. In July, the House overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan CLARITY Act by a vote of 294-134. The time is now. We must keep pace with the rest of the globe by enacting digital asset market structure by the end of the year.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Gemini Space Station (GEMI), the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has seen its shares tumble by more than 20% since listing on the Nasdaq last Friday.\n\nThe stock is down around 6% on Tuesday, trading at $30.42, and has dropped nearly 24% over the past week. The sharp decline follows an initial surge after the company raised $425 million in its IPO, pricing shares at $28 and valuing the firm at $3.3 billion before trading began.\n\nOn its first day, GEMI spiked to $45.89 before closing at $32 — a 14% premium to its offer price. But since hitting that high, shares have plunged more than 34%, erasing most of the early enthusiasm from public market investors.\n\nThe broader crypto equity market has remained more stable. Coinbase (COIN), the largest U.S. crypto exchange, is flat over the past week. Robinhood (HOOD), which derives part of its revenue from crypto, is down 3%. Token issuer Circle (CRCL), on the other hand, is up 13% over the same period.\n\nPart of the pressure on Gemini’s stock may stem from its financials. The company posted a $283 million net loss in the first half of 2025, following a $159 million loss in all of 2024. Despite raising fresh capital, the numbers suggest the business is still far from turning a profit.\n\nCompass Point analyst Ed Engel noted that GEMI is currently trading at 26 times its annualized first-half revenue. That multiple — often used to gauge whether a stock is expensive — means investors are paying 26 dollars for every dollar the company is expected to generate in sales this year.

    "title": "ETH Going to $5,500 by Mid-October, Says Fundstrat’s Global Head of Technical Strategy",
    "content": "According to CoinDesk Data, ether\nETH\n$4,518.26\ntraded at $4,506, down 0.5% in the past 24-hour period, as of 12:24 UTC on Sept. 16, slipping slightly in the past 24 hours as traders debate whether this pullback will set up the next rally.\n\nMark Newton, Global Head of Technical Strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, described the decline as the correction the market missed last week.\n\nHe does not expect ether to fall below its prior low of $4,233. Instead, he sees possible dips to $4,418 or $4,375 by week’s end — levels he calls buying opportunities. Newton projects ether could climb to $5,500 by mid-October, pointing to continued market strength.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, ether lost about 3% during Sept. 15’s trading window, dropping from a peak of $4,619 to around $4,500.\n\nThe steepest slide occurred between 07:00 and 08:00 UTC, when prices fell sharply from $4,632 to $4,514. Trading activity surged during that period, with volume more than doubling the daily average of 194,000 units and total turnover for the session reaching 501,741 units.\n\nAfter touching a low of $4,471, buyers stepped in to slow the decline. That level has served as a short-term “floor.” On the upside, ether struggled to move past $4,671, which has acted as a “ceiling.”\n\nLater in the session, between 23:00 UTC on Sept. 15 and 00:00 UTC on Sept. 16, prices steadied. Ether edged up from $4,497 to $4,505 and narrowed into a tight band between $4,479 and $4,505. Buyer interest around $4,490–$4,495 helped stabilize the market, but the token could not reclaim $4,530, showing sellers still had control at higher levels.\n\nIn total, the trading window covered a $200 range between $4,471 and $4,671, underscoring heightened uncertainty.

    "title": "HBAR Retreats After Strong Run Amid Late Wave of Sell Pressure",
    "content": "HBAR saw sharp selling pressure in the final hour of trading on Sept. 16, erasing earlier gains. The token slipped from $0.237 to $0.235 between 13:15 and 14:14 UTC, a 1.05% decline, after hitting an intraday high of $0.2385. The move marked a reversal from the preceding 23-hour stretch, when HBAR had climbed steadily from $0.23 to $0.24.\n\nThe late-session selloff was accompanied by a spike in trading activity, particularly between 13:45 and 13:51 UTC, when volumes surged past 5.6 million — nearly double the baseline for the session. The pattern suggests institutional distribution, as the cryptocurrency broke through successive support levels at $0.237, $0.236, and ultimately $0.235. Failure to recover above these levels left momentum deteriorating into the close.\n\nDespite the abrupt reversal, HBAR’s broader 23-hour performance reflected underlying resilience. The token advanced roughly 1% during that period, trading within a wide range of $0.231 to $0.239 and showing strong buying activity earlier on Sept. 16. However, the inability to sustain higher levels in the face of concentrated sell pressure underscores the fragility of recent bullish sentiment.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "The Clarity Act Is Probably Dead: Here's What's Next for Its Successor Legislation",
    "content": "It was a big moment for U.S. crypto when the House of Representatives cleared the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act that would set the regulatory stage for the industry. But before the dust settled on that eye-popping 294-134 vote, the Senate was working on a separate but similar bill that will almost certainly steal the show.\n\nIn much the same way that President Donald Trump leaned on House lawmakers to approve the Senate's stablecoin bill as written, without putting their own stamp on it, any market structure legislation that clears the more difficult hurdle of the Senate's 60-vote demand is likely to be a carefully balanced compromise that the administration will want approved as-is by the House.\n\nThroughout crypto's U.S. policy journey, the House has taken an early lead on crafting legislation, and the Senate has been the more difficult battlefield. That hasn't stopped prominent House Republicans such as Majority Whip Tom Emmer and House FInancial Services Committee Chairman French Hill from urging the Senate to just take up their Clarity Act and pass it.\n\n\"The Senate must finish the job on America’s pro-crypto future and pass the CLARITY Act,\" Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, wrote in a social-media post on X last week. Were the Senate to approve the House bill without changes, it would move straight to Trump's desk.\n\nBut pro-crypto lawmakers in the Senate have their own ideas and are trying to hatch a strategy that satisfies enough Democrats there that the final bill — whatever it's called — gets a massive jolt of Democratic support in its final Senate vote before heading to the House for a potential sign-off.\n\nSo, here are the steps it's got to take before U.S. crypto firms are officially and completely regulated in the U.S.:\n\nThe Senate bill, like the Clarity Act before it, would establish clear borderlines between the labels for digital assets and what agencies should be regulating them. While the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) Act is already the law to regulate stablecoin issuers, the next bill will tackle much of the rest of the industry, and it's likely to elevate the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to a leading role in the crypto world.\n\nIn the Senate's legislative work so far, the public has only seen a lengthy, 182-page discussion draft released by Republicans. It hasn't yet been formally introduced, though members of the Senate Banking Committee have said they'd like to get it to the amendment stage in a couple of weeks and set it for a committee vote. (That process may not be as smooth as they'd hope, though, since Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana has already made it clear he thinks it isn't yet ready.)\n\nAdding to the usual difficulties of Senate bandwidth, the two parties are currently in what could ratchet into a tense standoff over the U.S. spending plan, in which a government shutdown is again looming if they can't find common ground. The nature of the Senate can mean it functions as a one-thing-at-a-time chamber.\n\n\"I don't want to put an artificial deadline on anything, because we're in the middle of negotiations about whether we're going to have a bipartisan budget,\" said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat that's been working toward bipartisan crypto legislation for years. \"So the most important issue that Congress has to deal with right now is the fiscal cliff.\"\n\nThat negotiation \"is going to consume a lot of people's time,\" she said at a CoinDesk event in Washington last week.\n\nOnce a crypto bill clears the Senate, Trump's newest crypto adviser, Patrick Witt, told CoinDesk in an interview that the White House would expect it will have been written in close contact with House lawmakers and should be approved by that chamber as-written.\n\nBut even if the long-awaited market structure legislation becomes law at the end of 2025, it then starts what may be an even longer process to be interpreted and translated into the new regulations that will govern the sector through a number of federal agencies. Regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, CFTC and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have to dig through their requirements and figure out how to meet them — a process that involves making proposals and putting them out for public comment.\n\nThe typical rulemaking process can take a year or two, even when it's not overly complicated or controversial. This is a whole new regulatory field, and it has a higher level of public interest than some arcane revision of securities regulations. The comments will be numerous.\n\nThe last time the U.S. financial regulators took on a massive project that involved multiple new arenas of regulation was as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and there's still one core aspect of that law that hasn't been implemented by the regulators.\n\nAt the soonest, the U.S. regulatory apparatus would grind deep into 2026 before producing the regulations, and new financial standards have historically come with an implementation window of a year or two before they must be followed.\n\nThe Clarity Act was effectively just a starting gun.\n\nRead More: Father of Crypto Bills, French Hill, Says Market Structure Effort Should Tweak GENIUS\n\nMore For You\n\nState of Crypto: What Happens to Crypto if Government Shutdown Lingers\n\nA short-term shutdown probably won't hurt crypto's efforts in D.C. much.

    "title": "Is Ethereum’s DeFi Future on L2s? Liquidity, Innovation Say Perhaps Yes",
    "content": "Ethereum is in the midst of a paradox. Even as ether hit record highs in late August, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Ethereum’s layer-1 (L1) looks muted compared to its peak in late 2021. Fees collected on mainnet in August were just $44 million, a 44% drop from the prior month.\n\nMeanwhile, layer-2 (L2) networks like Arbitrum and Base are booming, with $20 billion and $15 billion in total value locked (TVL) respectively.\n\nThis divergence raises a crucial question: are L2s cannibalizing Ethereum’s DeFi activity, or is the ecosystem evolving into a multi-layered financial architecture?\n\nAJ Warner, the chief strategy officer of Offchain Labs, the developer firm behind layer-2 Arbitrum, argues that the metrics are more nuanced than just layer-2 DeFi chipping at the layer 1.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk, Warner said that focusing solely on TVL misses the point, and that Ethereum is increasingly functioning as crypto’s “global settlement layer,” a foundation for high-value issuance and institutional activity. Products like Franklin Templeton’s tokenized funds or BlackRock’s BUIDL product launch directly on Ethereum L1 — activity that isn’t fully captured in DeFi metrics but underscores Ethereum’s role as the bedrock of crypto finance.\n\nEthereum as a layer-1 blockchain is the secure but relatively slow and expensive base network. Layer-2s are scaling networks built on top of it, designed to handle transactions faster and at a fraction of the cost before ultimately settling back to Ethereum for security. That’s why they’ve become so appealing to traders and builders alike. Metrics like TVL, the amount of crypto deposited in DeFi protocols, highlight this shift, as activity is moved to L2s where lower fees and quicker confirmations make everyday DeFi far more practical.\n\nWarner likens Ethereum’s place in the ecosystem to a wire transfer in traditional finance: trusted, secure and used for large-scale settlement. Everyday transactions, however, are migrating to L2s — the Venmos and PayPals of crypto.\n\n“Ethereum was never going to be a monolithic blockchain with all the activity happening on it,” Warner told CoinDesk. Instead, it’s meant to anchor security while enabling rollups to execute faster, cheaper and more diverse applications.\n\nLayer 2s, which have exploded over the last few years because they are seen as the faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, enable whole categories of DeFi that don’t function as well on mainnet. Fast-paced trading strategies, like arbitraging price differences between exchanges or running perpetual futures, don’t work well on Ethereum’s slower 12-second blocks. But on Arbitrum, where transactions finalize in under a second, those same strategies become possible, Warner explained. This is apparent, as Ethereum has had fewer than 50 million transactions over the last month, compared to Base’s 328 million transactions and Arbitrum’s 77 million transactions, according to L2Beat.\n\nBuilders also see L2s as an ideal testing ground. Alice Hou, a research analyst at Messari, pointed to innovations like Uniswap V4’s hooks, customizable features that can be iterated far more cheaply on L2s before going mainstream. For developers, quicker confirmations and lower costs are more than a convenience: they expand what’s possible.\n\n“L2s provide a natural playground to test these kinds of innovations, and once a hook achieves breakout popularity, it could attract new types of users who engage with DeFi in ways that weren’t feasible on L1,” Hou said.\n\nBut the shift isn’t just about technology. Liquidity providers are responding to incentives. Hou said that data shows smaller liquidity providers increasingly prefer L2s where yield incentives and lower slippage amplify returns. Larger liquidity providers, however, still cluster on Ethereum, prioritizing security and depth of liquidity over bigger yields.\n\nInterestingly, while L2s are capturing more activity, flagship DeFi protocols like Aave and Uniswap still lean heavily on mainnet. Aave has consistently kept about 90% of its TVL on Ethereum. With Uniswap however, there’s been an incremental shift towards L2 activity.\n\nAnother factor accelerating L2 adoption is user experience. Wallets, bridges and fiat on-ramps increasingly steer newcomers directly to L2s, Hou said. Ultimately, the data suggests the L1 vs. L2 debate isn’t zero-sum.\n\nAs of September 2025, about a third of L2 TVL still comes bridged from Ethereum, another third is natively minted, and the rest comes via external bridges.\n\n“This mix shows that while Ethereum remains a key source of liquidity, L2s are also developing their own native ecosystems and attracting cross-chain assets,” Hou said.\n\nEthereum thus as a base layer appears to be cementing itself as the secure settlement engine for global finance, while rollups like Arbitrum and Base are emerging as execution layers for fast, cheap and creative DeFi applications.\n\n“Most payments I make use something like Zelle or PayPal… but when I bought my home, I used a wire. That’s somewhat parallel to what’s happening between Ethereum layer one and layer twos,” Warner of Offchain Labs said.\n\nRead more: Ethereum DeFi Lags Behind, Even as Ether Price Crossed Record Highs\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

The BNB price climbed to $933.03 through a series of large-volume transactions that pierced technical resistance, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.\n\nThe increase, part of a broader move, reflects growing interest from market participants positioning themselves ahead of a potential shift in U.S. interest rates.

    "content": "Swiss banking powerhouse UBS, crypto banking specialist Sygnum and PostFinance, a subsidiary company of the state-owned Swiss Post, successfully tested payments between institutions on Ethereum, according to a press release on Tuesday.\n\nThe proof of concept, run under the Swiss Bankers Association, saw UBS, PostFinance, and Sygnum Bank carry out transactions using deposit tokens — digital representations of bank deposits that can move on a public blockchain.\n\nThe payments were settled legally between banks without relying on the traditional payment system. The transactions were conducted on Ethereum using a permissioned framework.\n\nSwitzerland already has an efficient domestic payments network, but traditional systems can’t handle programmable conditions or integrate easily with blockchain-based markets, the companies said. With deposit tokens, transfers could in the future be processed instantly and tied to automated conditions through smart contracts.\n\nFor example, a securities trade could settle as soon as ownership is transferred, or an insurance payout could trigger once a claim is validated.\n\nThe trial tested two use cases: peer-to-peer payments between customers of different banks and an escrow-like setup where deposit tokens were swapped for tokenized assets.\n\nWhile the project confirmed technical and legal feasibility, scaling the system will require broader participation from banks, infrastructure providers and regulators.

    "title": "Solana Stronger Bet Than ETH as SOL Holds Key Support, Says Analyst",
    "content": "According to CoinDesk Data, Solana's SOL traded at $232.11 as of 12:30 UTC on Sept. 16, holding relatively firm after a choppy day that saw prices test both the $230 and $238 levels.\n\nAltcoin Sherpa, a widely followed trader, said earlier today on X that he sees SOL and BNB as stronger bets than ETH. He noted that new funding flows and market structures appear more SOL-oriented, while ETH has already made a substantial run and may need time to consolidate.\n\nHe added that majors still move in step with BTC: if BTC weakens, it is unlikely SOL, BNB, or ETH will keep rising. But if bitcoin rallies on positive macro developments, he expects majors to follow — with SOL and BNB likely leading in performance. Sherpa said he remains long both SOL and BNB, while his ether position is comparatively small.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, SOL traded within an $8 range during the Sept. 15–16 analysis window, moving between a $238.09 high and a $230.13 low.\n\nThe heaviest selling occurred between 12:00 and 17:00 UTC on Sept. 15, when SOL slid nearly $8 from peak to trough. Volume spiked to 1.5 million units during this decline, marking intense selling pressure.\n\nAfterward, buyers repeatedly defended the $233–$234 area, establishing a short-term “floor.” SOL consolidated with participation from around 650,000 units of volume, suggesting a mix of institutional distribution and retail accumulation.\n\nToward the end of the session, price action improved. Between 07:00 and 08:00 UTC on Sept. 16, SOL broke out of a tight $235.52–$236.50 band, briefly climbing to $236.90 on a 46,000-unit spike in just a few minutes. That surge pushed the price toward a $237.50–$238 resistance zone before momentum cooled.\n\nOverall, the data shows SOL stabilizing after sharp swings, with a clear support base near $233 and a ceiling forming between $237.50 and $238.\n\nThe latest 24-hour CoinDesk Data chart, ending at 12:30 UTC on Sept. 16, shows SOL at $232.11 after retreating from a $236–$237 intraday zone. Trading narrowed into the $232–$234 band, reinforcing that area as short-term support.\n\nThe one-month chart shows SOL still trending upward overall, though the recent pullback highlights that SOL is testing its support base rather than extending gains. The consolidation suggests the token may need to gather momentum before another attempt higher.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Asia Morning Briefing: Fragility or Back on Track? BTC Holds the Line at $115K",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,515.89\ntraded just above $115k in Asia Tuesday morning, slipping slightly after a strong start to the week.\n\nThe modest pullback followed a run of inflows into U.S. spot ETFs and lingering optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut rates next week. The moves left traders divided: is this recovery built on fragile foundations, or is crypto firmly back on track after last week’s CPI-driven jitters?\n\nThat debate is playing out across research desks. Glassnode’s weekly pulse emphasizes fragility. While ETF inflows surged nearly 200% last week and futures open interest jumped, the underlying spot market looks weak.\n\nBuying conviction remains shallow, Glassnode writes, funding rates have softened, and profit-taking is on the rise with more than 92% of supply in profit.\n\nOptions traders have also scaled back downside hedges, pushing volatility spreads lower, which Glassnode warns leaves the market exposed if risk returns. The core message: ETFs and futures are supporting the rally, but without stronger spot flows, BTC remains vulnerable.\n\nQCP takes the other side.\n\nThe Singapore-based desk says crypto is “back on track” after CPI confirmed tariff-led inflation without major surprises. They highlight five consecutive days of sizeable BTC ETF inflows, ETH’s biggest inflow in two weeks, and strength in XRP and SOL even after ETF delays.\n\nTraders, they argue, are interpreting regulatory postponements as inevitability rather than rejection. With the Altcoin Season Index at a 90-day high, QCP sees BTC consolidation above $115k as the launchpad for rotation into higher-beta assets.\n\nThe divide underscores how Bitcoin’s current range near $115k–$116k is a battleground. Glassnode calls it fragile optimism; QCP calls it momentum. Which side is right may depend on whether ETF inflows keep offsetting profit-taking in the weeks ahead.\n\nBTC: Bitcoin is consolidating near the $115,000 level as traders square positions ahead of expected U.S. Fed policy moves; institutional demand via spot Bitcoin ETFs is supporting upside\n\nETH: ETH is trading near $4500 in a key resistance band; gains are being helped by renewed institutional demand, tightening supply (exchange outflows), and positive technical setups.\n\nGold: Gold continues to hold near record highs, underpinned by expectations of Fed interest rate cuts, inflation risk, and investor demand for safe havens; gains tempered somewhat by profit‑taking and a firmer U.S. dollar\n\nNikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 topped 45,000 for the first time Monday, leading Asia-Pacific gains as upbeat U.S.-China trade talks and a TikTok divestment framework lifted sentiment.\n\nS&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.5% to close above 6,600 for the first time on Monday as upbeat U.S.-China trade talks and anticipation of a Fed meeting lifted stocks.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel (NBCTF) has published a list of 187 cryptocurrency addresses it says are linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a group sanctioned and designated as terrorist by the U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada.\n\nAccording to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, those addresses collectively received $1.5 billion in USDT, Tether’s dollar-pegged stablecoin. However, Elliptic cautioned that it cannot verify that all these funds are directly connected to the IRGC, since some wallets may belong to exchanges or services used by multiple customers.\n\nThe use of USDT exposes such wallets to one of Tether’s most powerful compliance tools: blacklisting. Of the 187 addresses flagged by Israel, 39 had already been frozen by Tether as of Sept. 13, preventing further transfers of roughly $1.5 million in USDT.\n\nIran’s Revolutionary Guard has been tied to illicit crypto activity for years. Just last week, the U.S. Justice Department seized nearly $600,000 in USDT from an Iranian national accused of building drone navigation systems for the IRGC.\n\nIn December 2024, U.S. Treasury sanctions targeted wallets linked to IRGC networks moving more than $300 million in stablecoins via an intermediary connected to Yemen’s Houthis.\n\nAnd in June 2025, the pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande (“Predatory Sparrow”) stole $90 million from Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex, which Elliptic and others have linked to IRGC activities including ransomware operations. The hackers “burned” the stolen funds in vanity wallets marked with anti-IRGC slogans, and even leaked Nobitex’s source code.\n\nThe hack was seen as a hammer blow to Iran, which is alleged to have used crypto to evade sanctions.\n\nUPDATE, Sep. 17 12:46 UTC: Updates headline.\n\nMore For You\n\nSquare Launches Bitcoin Payment Tools for Small Businesses\n\nThe features allow U.S. sellers to accept BTC, convert fiat sales automatically and manage crypto alongside traditional finances.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "XLM Sees Heavy Volatility as Institutional Selling Weighs on Price",
    "content": "Stellar’s XLM token endured sharp swings over the past 24 hours, tumbling 3% as institutional selling pressure dominated order books. The asset declined from $0.39 to $0.38 between September 14 at 15:00 and September 15 at 14:00, with trading volumes peaking at 101.32 million—nearly triple its 24-hour average. The heaviest liquidation struck during the morning hours of September 15, when XLM collapsed from $0.395 to $0.376 within two hours, establishing $0.395 as firm resistance while tentative support formed near $0.375.\n\nDespite the broader downtrend, intraday action highlighted moments of resilience. From 13:15 to 14:14 on September 15, XLM staged a brief recovery, jumping from $0.378 to a session high of $0.383 before closing the hour at $0.380. Trading volume surged above 10 million units during this window, with 3.45 million changing hands in a single minute as bulls attempted to push past resistance. While sellers capped momentum, the consolidation zone around $0.380–$0.381 now represents a potential support base.\n\nMarket dynamics suggest distribution patterns consistent with institutional profit-taking. The persistent supply overhead has reinforced resistance at $0.395, where repeated rally attempts have failed, while the emergence of support near $0.375 reflects opportunistic buying during liquidation waves. For traders, the $0.375–$0.395 band has become the key battleground that will define near-term direction.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "Contrary to claims from the U.S. banking industry, stablecoins do not pose a risk to the financial system, according to the chief policy officer at crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), Faryar Shirzad. Banks' claims that they do are are myths crafted to defend their revenues, he wrote in a Tueday blog post.\n\n\"The central claim — that stablecoins will cause a mass outflow of bank deposits — simply doesn’t hold up,\" Shirzad wrote. \"Recent analysis shows no meaningful link between stablecoin adoption and deposit flight for community banks and there’s no reason to believe big banks would fare any worse.\"\n\nLarger lenders still hold trillions of dollars at the Federal Reserve and if deposits were really at risk, he argued, they would be competing harder for customer funds by offering higher interest rates rather than parking cash at the central bank\n\nAccording to Shirzad, the real reason for banks' opposition is the payments business. Stablecoins, digital tokens whose value is pegged to a real-life asset such as the dollar, offer faster and cheaper ways to move money, threatening an estimated $187 billion in annual swipe-fee revenue for traditional card networks and banks.\n\nHe compared the current pushback to earlier battles against ATMs and online banking, when incumbents warned of systemic dangers but, he said, were ultimately trying to protect entrenched profits.\n\nShirzad also dismissed reports predicting trillions in potential outflows from deposits into stablecoins, whose total market cap is around $290 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. He stressed that stablecoins are primarily used as payment tools — for trading digital assets or sending funds abroad — not as long-term savings products.\n\nSomeone purchasing stablecoins to settle with an overseas supplier, he argued, is opting for a more efficient transaction method the going through their bank, not pulling money from a savings account.\n\nHe urged banks to embrace the technology instead of resisting it, saying stablecoin rails could cut settlement times, lower correspondent banking costs and provide round-the-clock payments. Those institutions willing to adapt, he wrote, stand to benefit from the shift.\n\nThe U.K., too, faces concerns about the effect of stablecoins on the financial industry.\n\nThe Financial Times reported Monday that the Bank of England is considering setting limits on how many \"systemic\" stablecoins people and companies can hold — setting thresholds as low as 10,000 pounds ($13,600) for individuals and about 10 million pounds for businesses.\n\nOfficials define systemic stablecoins as those already widely used for U.K. payments or expected to become so, and say the caps are needed to prevent sudden deposit outflows that could weaken lending and financial stability.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin Again Runs Into 2017-21 Trendline, SOL Flashes 'Shooting Star' Warning",
    "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nA few days ago, CoinDesk highlighted three potential hurdles that could trip up bitcoin's\nBTC\n$123,453.03\nmarch toward $120,000, one of which was the well-established bull fatigue zone above $116,000, in place since July. Sure enough, BTC's recent bounce from lows around $107,200 has hit a wall, failing to break decisively beyond $116,000 since last Friday.\n\nThat resistance aligns closely with a key trendline connecting the bull market peaks of December 2017 and November 2021, a price ceiling that’s capped BTC’s upside in July and August, as shown by the long upper wicks on the monthly candles. The bulls tried twice already but couldn’t hold above this line.\n\nCan the bulls crack it on a third attempt? Possibly. Many analysts expect bitcoin to continue grinding higher into year-end, buoyed by the widely anticipated Fed rate cut. But a third consecutive failure here would strengthen the bears’ hand, potentially fueling a deeper pullback.\n\nThe first warning signs of a breakdown could emerge if daily prices slip below the Ichimoku cloud, currently acting as a zone of indecision. As of writing, bitcoin trades within that cloud, offering little directional clarity. Crosses above or below this cloud often signal shifts in momentum, so traders should watch carefully.\n\nWhile enthusiasm around a solana's\nSOL\n$229.12\nprice prospects remains high, the technicals suggest a note of caution. On Sunday, SOL formed a classic \"shooting star\" candlestick after hitting a multi-month high near $250, only to pull back sharply by the close.\n\nThis pattern, a small real body with a long upper shadow after a protracted uptrend, as in SOL's case, signals that buyers pushed prices higher but ultimately lost control to sellers, who drove the price back down near the day’s low.\n\nThe bearish signal was confirmed when prices dipped further to about $230 on Monday, indicating a possible trend reversal.\n\nFor bulls to regain control, SOL would need to reclaim and hold above the $250 peak. Otherwise, the path looks toward a deeper decline, especially if the Fed’s upcoming decision disappoints markets by implying a more hawkish stance over the coming months.\n\nEther\nETH\n$4,523.30\n, meanwhile, seems to have lost its earlier momentum, drifting sideways after hitting an all-time high near $5,000 last month. The price action has formed a symmetrical triangle – a technical pattern representing indecision, where neither bulls nor bears are ready to make a decisive move.\n\nThese triangles typically resolve with a breakout or breakdown, setting the tone for the next directional move. For now, it’s best to wait for clear signals as Ether’s price consolidates within this tightening range.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "ORQO Group, a new institutional asset manager with $370 million in assets under management, has launched on Tuesday with plans to build out a yield platform for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin.\n\nThe group, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, consolidates four entities from both traditional finance and digital assets: Mount TFI, a private debt specialist and licensed fund manager in Poland, Monterra Capital, a multi-strategy digital hedge fund in Malta, blockchain engineering studio Nextrope and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Soil compliant with MiCA, the EU's crypto framework.\n\nAlready licensed in Poland and Malta, the group is seeking approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market to expand services in the Middle East, a region it sees as a hub for regulated digital asset growth.\n\n\"It's an opportunity to become a global on-chain asset manager,\" ORQO CEO Nicholas Motz said in an interview with CoinDesk. \"We have all the pieces: the off-chain asset management, and on-chain, too.\"\n\nORQO's effort is part of a larger trend that's been reshaping crypto markets: moving traditional financial instruments like private credit, U.S. Treasuries, or trade finance deals onto blockchain networks. The process is also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Data from rwa.xyz shows that the RWA market has grown into a nearly $30 billion sector, though it remains tiny compared to traditional finance markets such as the $2 trillion private credit sector. Still, the growth potential is immense: the tokenized RWA market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, a joint report by Ripple and BCG projected.\n\nYield platform Soil is a key piece in ORQO's gameplan, connecting the firm's RWA access with crypto capital capital. It aims to provide returns on stablecoins deposits from tokenized private credit, real estate and hedge fund strategies.\n\nAs part of the next stage, the firm plans to open several credit pools targeting holders of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin in the near future, allowing investors such as institutional treasuries or protocol reserves to earn a yield on their holdings.\n\nRead more: Tokenization of Real-World Assets is Gaining Momentum, Says Bank of America\n\nMore For You\n\nSquare Launches Bitcoin Payment Tools for Small Businesses\n\nThe features allow U.S. sellers to accept BTC, convert fiat sales automatically and manage crypto alongside traditional finances.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nSuddenly, it's all about Ethereum rival Solana and its native token SOL as the broader market holds its breath ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision.\n\nMichael Novogratz, the founder and CEO of Galaxy Investment, says Solana could evolve to become a settlement infrastructure in global finance. Why? Because the blockchain can handle over 6 billion transactions a day, which is way higher than the 400 million-700 million trades global securities markets usually deal with, he said. Speed matters.\n\nAt BaseCamp 2025, Coinbase’s layer-2 network hinted at plans for a token launch that could accelerate decentralization and unveiled a Solana bridge to boost cross-chain connectivity. Pantera Capital's Dan Morehead announced that Solana is their largest bet, valued at $1.1 billion, calling it the fastest and best-performing blockchain, which has outpaced even Bitcoin over the past four years.\n\nIf that's not enough, Kyle Samani, chairman of Nasdaq-listed Solana treasury company Forward Industries, said over the weekend that the company plans to deploy funds to boost the Solana-native decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nAll these signs suggest SOL could outperform bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,453.03\n, ether\nETH\n$4,523.30\nand other major tokens if the Fed cuts rates by the 25 basis points this week, as expected. If it surprises with a 50-basis-point move, things could get wild. Keep your eyes on those SOL/BTC and SOL/ETH trading pairs.\n\nCurrently, SOL is trading around $235 after peaking near $250 over the weekend. Other major cryptocurrencies are stuck in neutral, trailing behind stocks, which continue to hit fresh highs.\n\nOn the stablecoin front, the Bank of England proposed limits on how the value of dollar-backed stablecoins an individual can hold, as low as 10,000 pounds ($13,600), citing systemic risks. Stani Kulechov, Aave’s CEO, called the move “absurd” and urged the crypto community to stand up against such regulations.\n\nMore countries, especially those with current account deficits, will likely consider similar measures to curb outflows that dodge traditional banks.\n\nAnd as for the traditional markets, Monday’s mix of rising stocks and the VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, has some observers raising their eyebrows. History shows these moments often precede market corrections, so stay alert!\n\nBy Oliver Knight\n\nCrypto Treasury Companies\n\nSpot BTC ETFs\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors\n\nMore For You\n\nGold's Historic Run Dwarfs BTC But Analyst Remains Positive: Crypto Daybook Americas\n\nYour day-ahead look for Oct. 8, 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day.

His appointment underscores the foundation’s push to deepen engagement with policymakers as blockchain adoption expands globally.\n\n“We are honored to welcome Lord Holmes to the Avalanche Foundation’s board,” said Nicolas Lemaitre, a director of the Foundation, in the release. “As blockchain adoption accelerates globally, his guidance will be invaluable in ensuring Avalanche continues to set the standard for openness, accessibility and trust in the digital economy.”\n\nHolmes played a key role in updating the U.K.’s legal framework for digital technologies. He helped drive the passage of the Electronic Trade Documents Bill, giving blockchain-enabled digital trade documents the same legal status as paper. He also introduced legislation on artificial intelligence regulation and fair labor practices and co-authored reports on democracy, digital skills and AI.\n\n“Inclusion is fundamental to innovation,” Holmes, a former Paralympian, said in the release. “Without diverse voices and perspectives, the potential of blockchain and related technologies cannot be fully realized. Right-sized regulation is not a barrier to innovation — it is essential for it.”\n\nThe foundation said Holmes’ addition to the board strengthens its mission to build a more accessible and trustworthy digital economy. His expertise will help the organization advance constructive regulatory dialogue worldwide and broaden adoption of blockchain-based tools.\n\nThe Avalanche Foundation is a non-profit supporting the Avalanche ecosystem through grants and initiatives in blockchain, AI and Web3.\n\nRead more: Grayscale Moves to Convert Avalanche Trust Into Spot ETF\n\nMore For You\n\nSquare Launches Bitcoin Payment Tools for Small Businesses\n\nThe features allow U.S. sellers to accept BTC, convert fiat sales automatically and manage crypto alongside traditional finances.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The bank's full assessment is wide enough to drive an army regiment through, with the bull case being $6,400 and the bear case $2,200.\n\nThe bank analysts said network activity remains the key driver of ether’s value, but much of the recent growth has been on layer-2s, where value “pass-through” to Ethereum’s base layer is unclear.\n\nCiti assumes just 30% of layer-2 activity contributes to ether’s valuation, putting current prices above its activity-based model, likely due to strong inflows and excitement around tokenization and stablecoins.\n\nA layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.\n\nExchange-traded fund (ETF) flows, though smaller than bitcoin’s\nBTC\n$123,471.81\n, have a bigger price impact per dollar, but Citi expects them to remain limited given ether's smaller market cap and lower visibility with new investors.\n\nMacro factors are seen adding only modest support.

    "title": "HBAR Tumbles 5% as Institutional Investors Trigger Mass Sell-Off",
    "content": "Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR token endured steep losses over a volatile 24-hour window between September 14 and 15, falling 5% from $0.24 to $0.23. The token’s trading range expanded by $0.01 — a move often linked to outsized institutional activity — as heavy corporate selling overwhelmed support levels. The sharpest move came between 07:00 and 08:00 UTC on September 15, when concentrated liquidation drove prices lower after days of resistance around $0.24.\n\nInstitutional trading volumes surged during the session, with more than 126 million tokens changing hands on the morning of September 15 — nearly three times the norm for corporate flows. Market participants attributed the spike to portfolio rebalancing by large stakeholders, with enterprise adoption jitters and mounting regulatory scrutiny providing the backdrop for the selloff.\n\nRecovery efforts briefly emerged during the final hour of trading, when corporate buyers tested the $0.24 level before retreating. Between 13:32 and 13:35 UTC, one accumulation push saw 2.47 million tokens deployed in an effort to establish a price floor. Still, buying momentum ultimately faltered, with HBAR settling back into support at $0.23.\n\nThe turbulence underscores the token’s vulnerability to institutional distribution events. Analysts point to the failed breakout above $0.24 as confirmation of fresh resistance, with $0.23 now serving as the critical support zone. The surge in volume suggests major corporate participants are repositioning ahead of regulatory shifts, leaving HBAR’s near-term outlook dependent on whether enterprise buyers can mount sustained defenses above key support.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

Still, the company is pushing forward with offering private equity access to retail investors.\n\n“For decades, wealthy people and institutions have invested in private companies while retail investors have been unfairly locked out,” Robinhood Chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev said.\n\nRobinhood pointed out that the number of public companies in the U.S. has dropped by nearly half since 2000, while the private market has ballooned to over $10 trillion in estimated value, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\nIf approved, Robinhood Ventures Fund I would invest in a small basket of private companies across various industries and hold them through IPO and beyond.

    "title": "Dogecoin Inches Closer to Wall Street With ETF Set for Launch This Week",
    "content": "The first exchange-traded fund (ETF) built around a meme coin could hit the market this week, after multiple delays and much speculation.\n\nThe DOGE ETF — formally called the Rex Shares-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) — was originally slated to debut last week, alongside a handful of politically themed and crypto-related ETFs. Those included funds tied to\nBONK\n$0.0₄2015\n, XRP, Bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,462.01\nand even a Trump-themed fund. But DOJE’s debut never materialized.\n\nNow, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart believe Thursday is the most likely launch date, though they caution nothing is certain.\n\n“It’s more likely than not,” Seyffart said. “That seems like the base case.”\n\nAhead of the introduction of the ETF, DOGE has been among the top performers over the past month, ahead 15% even including a decline of 3.5% over the past 24 horus.\n\nIf launched, DOJE would mark a milestone as the first U.S. ETF to focus on a meme coin — cryptocurrencies that generally lack utility or a clear economic purpose. These include tokens like Dogecoin,\nSHIB\n$0.0₄1241\nand Bonk, which often surge in popularity thanks to internet culture, celebrity endorsements and speculative trading.\n\nBalchunas described DOJE’s significance in a post on X: “First-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose.”\n\nDOJE is not a spot ETF. That means it won’t hold DOGE directly. Instead, the fund will use a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary to gain exposure through futures and other derivatives. This approach sidesteps the need for physical custody of the coin while still offering traders a way to bet on its performance within a traditional brokerage account.\n\nThe ETF was approved earlier this month under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is typically used for mutual funds and diversified ETFs. That sets it apart from the wave of bitcoin ETFs that received green lights under the Securities Act of 1933, a framework used for commodity-based and asset-backed products. In short, DOJE is structured more like a mutual fund than a commodity trust.\n\nMore direct exposure may be coming soon. Several firms have filed applications to launch spot DOGE ETFs, which would hold the meme coin itself rather than derivatives. These applications are still under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has grown more comfortable with crypto ETFs since approving a slate of bitcoin products in early 2024.\n\nThe broader crypto market has shown that investor demand can outweigh fundamental critiques. Meme coins have long drawn skepticism for having no underlying value or use case, but that hasn't kept them from drawing billions in speculative capital.\n\nSeyffart said the ETF market is likely to follow the same path. “There's going to be a bunch of products like this, whether you love it or need it, they're going to be coming to market,” he said.\n\nHe added that many existing financial products serve no deeper purpose than providing a vehicle for short-term bets. “There’s plenty of products out there that are just being used as gambling or short-term trading,” he said. “So if there's an audience for this in the crypto world, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this finds an audience in the ETF and TradFi world.”\n\nWhether the DOJE ETF opens the door to more meme coin funds — or just proves the concept is viable — may depend on how the market responds this week. Either way, it signals a new phase in the merging of internet culture and traditional finance.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and Dogecoin Lag Stocks as VIX Stirs Up Some Nerves",
    "content": "It's a risk-on environment, with stocks leading major cryptocurrencies higher, but Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX, is stirring up some nerves.\n\nOn Monday, Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500, set a record high for the fourth consecutive trading day, reaching 6,519 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index also hit lifetime highs, and the Dow Jones traded near the peak recorded on Thursday.\n\nEquities rose, disregarding the bearish September manufacturing survey, as bond yields fell in anticipation of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut on Wednesday. According to the Fed funds futures, traders expect rates to drop to 3% from the present 4.25% within the next 12 months.\n\nStill, bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,470.05\nlacked clear direction, as it traded back and forth between $114,000 and $117,000, forming an indecisive Doji candle. As of writing, it changed hands at $115,860, continuing a lacklustre trading pattern below record highs of above $124,000 hit in August.\n\nThe dour price action is likely due to long-term holders continuing to take profits and countering the bullish pressure from spot ETF inflows.\n\nOther major tokens such as ether\nETH\n$4,514.92\n,\nXRP\n$2.9070\nand\nDOGE\n$0.2589\nhave lost upward momentum too.\n\nEthereum's ether token has pulled back from nearly $4,800 to $4,500 in three days, having put in lifetime highs above $5,000 last month. The weakness is perplexing, as ether, popularly known as the internet bond due to its staking yield mechanism, stands to become an attractive investment with the impending Fed rate cuts.\n\nThe payments-focused XRP has pulled back to $3.00, marking a weak follow-through to the bullish breakout from the descending triangle confirmed last week. Meanwhile, dogecoin, the leading meme token by market value, has dropped sharply to 26.7 cents from 30.7 cents amid reports of whale selling.\n\nAnalysts said that a 25-basis-point rate cut could resume the slow grind higher in BTC. Meanwhile, a surprise 50 bps move could see stocks, crypto and gold go berserk.\n\nMonday's rise in U.S. stocks was characterized by an uptick in the VIX index, which represents the options-based implied or expected volatility in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days.\n\nThe VIX rose over 6% to 15.68 points. While it still largely hovers at multi-month lows, the Tuesday spike warrants attention for two reasons: First, historically, the two have moved in opposite directions, as evident from the correlation of nearly -90 over a 90-day period.\n\nSecondly, a breakdown in the negative correlation often precedes corrections, as noted by the quant-driven market intelligence platform Menthor Q on X.\n\n\"SPX rose with the VIX today. This often signals stretched upside positioning, traders grabbing calls or hedging downside [with puts], leaving markets vulnerable,\" Menthor Q said.\n\nThe VIX is influenced by demand for options, and Tuesday's rise in the index could have been led by traders seeking S&P 500 puts or downside protection.\n\nPerhaps, market participants anticipate a correction following the expected 25-basis-point Fed rate cut on Wednesday.\n\nVolmex's bitcoin implied volatility index, which represents the expected price turbulence over 30 days, also rose by 3% Monday, maintaining its positive correlation with VIX.\n\nNote that BTC's historic positive correlation with implied volatility indices has flipped negative since the spot ETFs went live in January last year and more so since President Trump's electoral win in November last year.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Crypto Finance, a subsidiary of Deutsche Börse Group, unveiled AnchorNote, a system designed for institutional clients who want to trade digital assets without moving them out of regulated custody.\n\nThe system integrates BridgePort, a network of crypto exchanges and custodians, enabling off-exchange settlement and connectivity to multiple trading venues. By keeping assets in custody while allowing real-time collateral movement, AnchorNote aims to improve capital efficiency and reduce counterparty risk, according to a press release.\n\nThe service allows clients to set up dedicated trading lines, with BridgePort handling messaging between venues and Crypto Finance acting as collateral custodian, the press release said. Institutions can manage collateral through a dashboard or integrate the service directly into their existing infrastructure using APIs, it said. APIs, or application programming interfaces, allow software programs to communicate directly with one another.\n\n“Institutional clients face a constant tradeoff between security and capital efficiency,” said Philipp E. Dettwiler, head of custody and settlement at Crypto Finance. “AnchorNote is designed to bridge that gap.”\n\nFor traders, the setup eliminates the need for pre-funding exchanges while providing immediate access to liquidity across platforms. In practice, a Swiss bank could pledge bitcoin held in custody and deploy it instantly across multiple trading venues without moving the coins on-chain.\n\nThe rollout begins in Switzerland, with Crypto Finance planning to expand across Europe.\n\nMore For You\n\nSquare Launches Bitcoin Payment Tools for Small Businesses\n\nThe features allow U.S. sellers to accept BTC, convert fiat sales automatically and manage crypto alongside traditional finances.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "CoreWeave (CRWV) were higher by about 5% in early U.S. trading Monday after the cloud computing company entered into a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia (NVDA) to guarantee use of its excess server capacity, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nUnder the agreement, Nvidia will buy any unused computing resources from CoreWeave through April 2032. The arrangement ensures that CoreWeave’s vast fleet of data centers will not sit idle if customer demand fluctuates. If CoreWeave’s clients don’t fully book its servers, Nvidia is obligated to step in and purchase the residual capacity. Either company can exit the deal if one breaches terms or faces bankruptcy.\n\nFor CoreWeave, the agreement locks in a long-term buyer for its spare capacity, reducing revenue risk as it builds out infrastructure. For Nvidia, it secures reliable access to cloud-based GPU resources at a time when demand for artificial intelligence training far exceeds supply. The agreement also strengthens ties between the two firms, as Nvidia not only supplies CoreWeave with GPUs but also holds an equity stake.\n\nNvidia has already made CoreWeave one of its biggest bets. At the end of the second quarter, the AI chipmaker owned 24.3 million shares of CoreWeave worth about $3.96 billion.\n\nCoreWeave, founded in 2017, rents out access to Nvidia graphics processing units that power AI model training. The firm went public in March in what was the largest U.S. venture-backed tech IPO since 2021. Leading up to its debut, it raised billions in debt and equity financing, including from Nvidia itself.\n\nThe stock surged roughly five-fold shortly following its April IPO, but subsequently lost about 50% during the summer.

    "content": "Meme-inspired cryptocurrency PEPE has lost nearly 6% of its value in the last 24-hour period, sliding to a $0.0000107 low even as large investors accumulate.\n\nTrading volumes for the cryptocurrency surged into the trillions of tokens amid the drop, as the token kept failing to find support amid the intense selling pressure. The drop came amid a wider crypto market drawdown, where the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index lost 1.8% of its value.\n\nMemecoins were especially hard hit in the sell-off. The CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME) dropped nearly 5% over the last 24 hours, while bitcoin saw a drop of 0.8%.\n\nThe drop comes just days after altcoin season speculation grew among cryptocurrency circles over the Federal Reserve’s expected interest rate cut later this week, which is expected to be a boon for risk assets.\n\nData from Nansen shows that over the past week, the top 100 non-exchange addresses holding PEPE on the Ethereum network have seen their holdings grow by 1.38% to 307.33 trillion tokens, while exchange wallets had a 1.45% drop in holdings to 254.4 trillion tokens.\n\nPEPE’s price action pointed to a market in retreat, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. The token dropped from $0.000011484 to $0.000010782, with sellers dominating the chart.\n\nPrice peaked at $0.000011732 during a resistance test, but volume swelled to 5.5 trillion tokens at that level, before the market ultimately turned lower.\n\nSupport showed signs of buckling during the next phase, with the token brushing against $0.000010746. Trading activity intensified again, hitting 7.7 trillion tokens and reinforcing bearish sentiment.\n\nThe cryptocurrency’s price whipsawed within a 9% intraday range, a sign that traders remain unsure whether support levels are going to hold.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "Ether Bigger Beneficiary of Digital Asset Treasuries Than Bitcoin or Solana: StanChart",
    "content": "Digital asset treasuries (DATs), publicly traded firms that hold crypto on their balance sheets, have been hit hard in recent weeks as their market NAVs (mNAVs) slid below 1, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick said in a new report.\n\nLooking ahead, ether\nETH\n$4,517.93\nDATs appear to have the most staying power thanks to staking yield, regulatory clarity, and room to grow, argued Kendrick.\n\nThe mNAV ratio is crucial. When it falls, these firms lose the incentive (and sometimes the ability) to keep buying crypto, threatening a key source of demand for bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,463.28\n, ether and solana (solana).\n\nKendrick said that the next phase for DATs will be one of differentiation. The winners will be those that can raise funds at the lowest cost, achieve scale that draws liquidity and investor attention, and, crucially, earn staking yield. That last point tilts the playing field toward ether and solana treasuries over bitcoin, which lacks yield.\n\nMarket saturation is also at play. Strategy’s success as the flagship BTC treasury has inspired a flood of copycats, nearly 90 at last count, who together now hold more than 150,000 BTC, up sixfold this year, the analyst noted.\n\nBut if mNAVs stay below 1, Standard Chartered expects consolidation. For BTC treasuries, that could mean firms like Saylor's Strategy buying out rivals rather than buying new bitcoin on the open market, a coin rotation, not fresh demand.\n\nEther treasuries look better positioned. They have been aggressively accumulating, with 3.1% of ETH’s circulating supply purchased since June. The largest player, Bitmine (BMNR) is well-placed to keep adding to its 2 million ETH stack, the report said.\n\nFor crypto markets, this matters. DAT buying has been a key driver of bitcoin and ether prices in 2025. But with BTC treasuries facing consolidation pressure and solana treasuries still relatively small, Standard Chartered sees ETH as the likely beneficiary going forward.\n\nRead more: Strategy's S&P 500 Snub Is a Cautionary Signal for Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries: JPMorgan\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Future integrations with decentralized finance protocols on Plasma are planned as the network builds out.\n\n“This launch underscores our excitement over Plasma and its importance as a payments ecosystem,” Maple CEO Sid Powell said in a statement.

    "title": "Crypto Advertising Is Inherently Political — and That’s a Good Thing",
    "content": "Advertising in crypto has often tried to sell a revolution.\n\n“If everything is fine, don’t change anything” says the latest Coinbase TV commercial, as Britain crumbles in the background. Larry David’s FTX ad compared crypto to the invention of the wheel, though his character wasn’t convinced.\n\nBut even campaigns that aren’t so provocative are still inseparable from the industry’s world view. A worldview which challenges the financial and societal norms we live by.\n\nCrypto’s products raise questions around control, access and trust. And that’s why the industry’s messaging and adverts so often read like advocacy. This political worldview is also one of the reasons why the industry and its advertising has faced so much suppression over the years.\n\nFrom its inception, the digital asset industry has positioned itself as an empowering and democratizing force. It has questioned centralized monetary policy, and proposed alternatives to how traditional financial systems operate. These are not neutral positions.\n\nThis threat to entrenched systems posed by the industry is one factor in why regulation around what digital asset companies can do or say has taken so long to develop. Even today when ads from crypto companies touch on those systemic critiques, some members of the public take offense and regulators get in the way of distribution.\n\nCoinbase’s now-infamous UK ad, which takes the spirit of crypto advocacy to its logical and creative conclusion, is a perfect example. Its message, that crypto offers a potential answer to a broken economy, may not have mentioned a party or candidate, but it still made a strong claim about policy and pointed a finger at what isn't working in modern day Britain.\n\nClearcast, the body which says yes or no to which ads can run on UK TV networks, disapproved the ad on the grounds that it “presented cryptocurrency as a potential solution to economic challenges, without sufficient evidence for this claim or any warnings about the potential volatility and risks”.\n\nYet even as crypto messaging faces rejection from regulators and broadcast platforms, major political actors, especially in the U.S., are beginning to embrace it.\n\nNot despite its political tone, but because of it.\n\nAt a recent panel, Trump strategist Chris LaCivita and Democrat campaigner David Plouffe found rare agreement: crypto is now a political issue worth supporting. LaCivita called it a “classic growth issue,” opening doors to young and minority voters, while Plouffe warned:\n\n“Tens of millions of Americans have a great desire to be a part of this. So as a politician, it’s very dangerous to say: we’re going to ignore you.”\n\nBoth LaCivita and Plouffe said crypto ownership has become such an important social issue that it can sway entire blocs of voters. Parties are taking notice, staking out positions and reshaping financial ecosystems when they win.\n\nIn a world where even the idea of a single-issue crypto voter is taken seriously by campaign strategists, how can anyone be surprised that the industry sounds political?\n\nThe argument over whether to treat advertising that touches on political issues differently has been raging for over a decade, ever since social media became a dominant force in modern American election cycles. What began as a concern about transparency in democratic campaigns has since evolved into a much broader question: who gets to speak, and on what terms, when the message challenges the status quo?\n\nRegulators and distribution platforms often claim there’s a clear, technical line between political and non-political content. In practice, that’s not how it works. What counts as political often depends on the climate of the moment. Messaging that’s allowed one year may be blocked in the next as rules are changed by social media platforms or legislative bodies.\n\nTake the EU’s incoming Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising Act as an example. This new rule which is set to come into force in October 2025 will tighten what’s considered political content, broadening the definition to include any ad that could influence public opinion on policy. In response to this, Meta and Google have already said they will end all political, electoral and social issue advertising in the EU when the rules come into force in October. This is a perfect example of a regulation that, while well-intentioned, could one day cause unfortunate roadblocks.\n\nIf crypto ads increasingly sound like political speech, it’s not a mistake. It’s a reflection of what the product actually represents, and online media platforms shouldn't get in the way of that.\n\nThe future of the industry is one where digital assets become an ever more present part of our daily lives. As these technologies become more deeply entrenched, the alternatives they offer will only become more important to people. The sway of the ‘crypto-electorate’ in the U.S.’s 2024 election cycle will undoubtedly be replicated in other democracies across the world and more parties will make it a part of their policy platforms.\n\nThere will be more and more crypto ads that speak directly to the social issues the industry represents. This is something that should be expected, and embraced, not feared or suppressed. In order for innovations to have impact we need to allow their communications to be provocative, outspoken, and, by all means — political.\n\nIt is only then that we will be able to have open and honest conversations about what is broken in our current system, and how we may be able to fix it.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Market watchdogs in France, Austria and Italy want the European Union to tighten its approach to crypto regulation, warning that uneven enforcement of the bloc’s landmark MiCA legislation could leave investors exposed to risks that aren't covered by the rules.\n\nIn a joint statement, France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), Austria’s Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde (FMA) and Italy’s Consob said the first months of MiCA’s rollout revealed “major differences” in how national supervisors apply the law. Without changes, they argued, firms may shop around for lenient jurisdictions, undermining both investor protection and Europe’s competitiveness in digital assets.\n\nThe regulators set out four proposals. Chief among them is handing direct supervision of the largest crypto-asset service providers to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). They also want to close loopholes allowing EU intermediaries to route orders to offshore platforms not bound by MiCA, a practice that leaves investors without regulatory safeguards.\n\nThe authorities also called for mandatory, independent cybersecurity audits before firms receive or renew MiCA licenses, citing the sector’s high exposure to hacks. Finally, they proposed a centralized filing system for token white papers to simplify cross-border offerings and ensure legal clarity.\n\nWhile MiCA was designed to harmonize crypto oversight across the EU, the three regulators say swift adjustments are needed to align with international standards set by the Financial Stability Board and IOSCO. Without them, they caution, national regulators may be forced into emergency measures that risk fracturing Europe’s digital asset market.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

We wanted to speak to it in a way that was natural for the travel experience itself, and so we talk about these things as stamps, and they're represented as tokens,” Marlowe said in an interview.\n\n“As an identifier and representation of history the stamps could create interesting partnership angles over time. We weren't trying to sell these or sort of generate any like short term revenue. The angle is to make a travel experience with Amex feel really rich, really different, and kind of set it apart,” he said.\n\nFireblocks is also involved, supporting Amex as its Wallet-as-a-Service provider for the passport product, a Fireblocks representative said.\n\nThe Amex travel app also includes a range of tools for travels and Centurion Lounge upgrades, the company said.\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "title": "Ethereum Foundation Starts New AI Team to Support Agentic Payments",
    "content": "The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is creating a dedicated artificial intelligence (AI) group to make Ethereum the settlement and coordination layer for what it calls the “machine economy,” according to research scientist Davide Crapis.\n\nCrapis, who announced the initiative Monday on X, said the new dAI Team will pursue two priorities: enabling AI agents to pay and coordinate without intermediaries, and building a decentralized AI stack that avoids reliance on a small number of large companies. He said Ethereum’s neutrality, verifiability and censorship resistance make it a natural base layer for intelligent systems.\n\nThe EF is a non-profit organization based in Zug, Switzerland, that funds and coordinates the development of the Ethereum blockchain. It does not control the network but plays a catalytic role by supporting researchers, developers and ecosystem projects.\n\nIts remit includes funding upgrades such as Ethereum 2.0, zero-knowledge proofs and layer-2 scaling, alongside community programs like the Ecosystem Support Program. The foundation also organizes events such as Devcon to foster collaboration and acts as a policy advocate for blockchain adoption.\n\nIn 2025, EF restructured to handle Ethereum’s growth, emphasizing ecosystem acceleration, founder support and enterprise outreach. The new dAI Team represents a continuation of this shift toward specialized units addressing emerging technologies.\n\nCrapis is a research scientist at the EF and will lead the new dAI Team. He said the group will connect its work with both the EF’s protocol group and its ecosystem support arm.\n\n“Ethereum makes AI more trustworthy, and AI makes Ethereum more useful,” he wrote, adding that the team intends to fund public goods and projects at the intersection of AI and blockchains.\n\nThe group will build on recent work around ERC-8004, a proposed Ethereum standard that Crapis described as a way to prove who an AI agent is and whether it can be trusted. By offering identity and reputation systems for autonomous agents, the standard is intended to allow coordination without centralized gatekeepers.\n\nCrapis said the team will support new standards and upgrades as they emerge, guided by Ethereum’s values and the “d/acc” philosophy of decentralized acceleration. The goal, he explained, is to ensure AI development remains open and verifiable while giving humans greater agency over how intelligent systems interact with the economy.\n\nFor Ethereum, the move signals a growing ambition to anchor emerging technologies beyond finance.\n\nIf AI agents begin transacting at scale, demand could grow for settlement rails, reputation systems and standards that run natively on Ethereum. For the AI community, the initiative offers an alternative to centralized platforms that currently dominate AI infrastructure.\n\n“The more intelligent agents transact, the more they need a neutral base layer for value and reputation,” Crapis said. “Ethereum benefits by becoming that layer and AI benefits by escaping lock-in to a few centralized platforms.”\n\nThe team has begun hiring and publishing resources, according to Crapis. He said EF intends to work “with purpose and urgency” to connect AI developers with the Ethereum ecosystem and to accelerate research at the boundary of the two fields.\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "content": "The Financial Times (FT) reported on Monday that cryptocurrency groups are urging the Bank of England (BoE) to scrap proposals limiting the amount of stablecoins individuals and businesses can own.\n\nThe groups warned that the rules would leave the UK with stricter oversight than the U.S. or the European Union (EU).\n\nAccording to the FT, BoE officials plan to impose caps of 10,000 british pounds to 20,000 British pounds ($13,600–$27,200) for individuals and about 10 million British pounds ($13.6 million) for businesses on all systemic stablecoins, defined as tokens already widely used for payments in the U.K. or expected to be in the future.\n\nThe central bank has argued the restrictions are needed to prevent outflows of deposits from banks that could weaken credit provision and financial stability.\n\nThe FT cited Sasha Mills, the BoE’s executive director for financial market infrastructure, as saying the limits would mitigate risks from sudden deposit withdrawals and the scaling of new systemic payment systems.\n\nHowever, industry executives told the FT the plan is unworkable.\n\nTom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s vice president of international policy, said “imposing caps on stablecoins is bad for U.K. savers, bad for the City and bad for sterling,” adding that no other major jurisdiction has imposed such limits.\n\nSimon Jennings of the UK cryptoasset business council said enforcement would be nearly impossible without new systems such as digital IDs. Riccardo Tordera-Ricchi of The Payments Association told the FT that limits “make no sense” because there are no caps on cash or bank accounts.\n\nThe U.S. enacted the GENIUS Act in July, which establishes a federal framework for payment stablecoins. The law sets licensing, reserve and redemption standards for issuers, with no caps on individual holdings. The European Union has also moved ahead with its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which is now fully in effect across the bloc.\n\nStablecoin-specific rules for asset-referenced and e-money tokens took effect on June 30, 2024, followed by broader provisions for crypto-assets and service providers on Dec. 30, 2024. Like the U.S. approach, MiCA does not cap holdings, instead focusing on reserves, governance and oversight by national regulators.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Memecoins Under Pressure as SHIB, Dogecoin Slide After Shibarium Loses $2.4M in Hack",
    "content": "Top meme tokens traded under pressure as a multimillion dollar hack of Shiba Inu's layer-2 network, Shibarium, dented investor confidence in joke cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn Sunday, Shibarium fell victim to a flash loan attack on its validator system, which drained about $2.4 million in ether\nETH\n$4,524.17\nand SHIB. The CoinDesk Memecoin Index has dropped 6.6% in the past 24 hours. The broader market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is down just 2.3%.\n\nThe attacker borrowed 4.6 million BONE, the governance token for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, often linked to the decentralized exchange (DEX) ShibaSwap, through a flash loan to gain control of the majority of validator keys. The keys act as gatekeepers of the network, confirming transactions and ensuring security.\n\nWith that control, the attacker was able to game the system into approving unauthorized transactions and walk away with a large amount of crypto assets from the bridge that connects Shibarium with the Ethereum blockchain. The process is akin to someone temporarily taking over a bank’s security system to approve unauthorized withdrawals. A flash loan is a loan raised with no upfront collateral and returns the borrowed assets within the same blockchain transaction.\n\nThe Shiba inu team was able to prevent a bigger, more serious breach because the BONE tokens used to gain control were reportedly tied to validator 1 and remained locked by the staking rules.\n\nNevertheless, markets reacted negatively breach, which again underscores the perennial security issues with blockchain technology.\n\nSHIB fell by the most in three weeks on Sunday (UTC), losing 4% $0.00001369, and has continued to weaken to trade recently at $0.00001359. The cryptocurrency experienced considerable volatility throughout the 23-hour trading window ended Sept. 15 at 02:00 UTC, with the aggregate range encompassing $0.000006191, a 4% oscillation from peak to trough.\n\nThe session commenced with pre-dawn fragility as SHIB retreated from $0.000014156 to establish a pivotal trough of $0.000013547 at 14:00 UTC. Volume of 1.064 trillion tokens surpassed the 24-hour mean, signaling robust distribution pressure and prospective capitulation, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.\n\nThe BONE token, which initially doubled to over 36 cents, is now down over 2% on a 24-hour basis, trading at around 20 cents.\n\nAccording to the technical analysis model:\n\nMeanwhile, SHIB's peer\nDOGE\n$0.2597\nfell 4% to 27.80 cents on Sunday and has since lost further 5% to 27.36 cents, according CoinDesk data.\n\nA massive transfer of DOGE to a centralized exchange likely added to the bearish mood in the market. According to Whale Alert, crypto exchange OKX received 119,306,143 DOGE, worth over $34 million, from an unknown wallet. Such large transfers are typically associated with an intention to liquidate holdings.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Sees Money Printing Extending Crypto Cycle Well Into 2026",
    "content": "Arthur Hayes believes the current crypto bull market has further to run, supported by global monetary trends he sees as only in their early stages.\n\nSpeaking in a recent interview with Kyle Chassé, a longtime bitcoin and Web3 entrepreneur, the BitMEX co-founder and current Maelstrom CIO argued that governments around the world are far from finished with aggressive monetary expansion.\n\nHe pointed to U.S. politics in particular, saying that President Donald Trump’s second term has not yet fully unleashed the spending programs that could arrive from mid-2026 onward. Hayes suggested that if expectations for money printing become extreme, he may consider taking partial profits, but for now he sees investors underestimating the scale of liquidity that could flow into equities and crypto.\n\nHayes tied his outlook to broader geopolitical shifts, including what he described as the erosion of a unipolar world order. In his view, such periods of instability tend to push policymakers toward fiscal stimulus and central bank easing as tools to keep citizens and markets calm.\n\nHe also raised the possibility of strains within Europe — even hinting that a French default could destabilize the euro — as another factor likely to accelerate global printing presses. While he acknowledged these policies eventually risk ending badly, he argued that the blow-off top of the cycle is still ahead.\n\nTurning to bitcoin, Hayes pushed back on concerns that the asset has stalled after reaching a record $124,000 in mid-August.\n\nHe contrasted its performance with other asset classes, noting that while U.S. stocks are higher in dollar terms, they have not fully recovered relative to gold since the 2008 financial crisis. Hayes pointed out that real estate also lags when measured against gold, and only a handful of U.S. technology giants have consistently outperformed.\n\nWhen measured against bitcoin, however, he believes all traditional benchmarks appear weak.\n\nHayes’ message was that bitcoin’s dominance becomes even clearer once assets are viewed through the lens of currency debasement.\n\nFor those frustrated that bitcoin is not posting fresh highs every week, Hayes suggested that expectations are misplaced.\n\nIn his telling, investors from the traditional world and those in crypto actually share the same premise: governments and central banks will print money whenever growth falters. Hayes says traditional finance tends to express this view by buying bonds on leverage, while crypto investors hold bitcoin as the “faster horse.”\n\nHis conclusion is that patience is essential. Hayes argued that the real edge of holding bitcoin comes from years of compounding outperformance rather than short-term speculation.\n\nCoupled with what he sees as an inevitable wave of money creation through the rest of the decade, he believes the present crypto cycle could stretch well into 2026, far from exhausted.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nHyperliquid’s validator community has chosen Native Markets to issue USDH, ending a weeklong contest that drew proposals from Paxos, Frax, Sky (ex-MakerDAO), Agora, and others.\n\nNative Markets, co-founded by former Uniswap Labs president MC Lader, researcher Anish Agnihotri, and early Hyperliquid backer Max Fiege, said it will begin rolling out USDH “within days,” according to a post by Fiege on X.\n\nAccording to onchain trackers, Native Markets' proposal took approximately 70% of validators' votes, while Paxos took 20%, and Ethena came in at 3.2%.\n\nThe staged launch starts with capped mints and redemptions, followed by a USDH/USDC spot pair before caps are lifted.\n\nUSDH is designed to challenge Circle’s USDC, which currently dominates Hyperliquid with nearly $6 billion in deposits, or about 7.5% of its supply. USDC and other stablecoins will remain supported if they meet liquidity and HYPE staking requirements.\n\nMost rival bidders had promised to channel stablecoin yields back to the ecosystem with Paxos via HYPE buybacks, Frax through direct user yield, and Sky with a 4.85% savings rate plus a $25 million “Genesis Star” project.\n\nNative Markets’ pitch instead stressed credibility, trading experience, and validator alignment.\n\nBTC: BTC has recently reclaimed the $115,000 level, helped by inflows into ETFs, easing U.S. inflation data, and growing expectations for interest rate cuts.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe crypto market has stalled since Saturday, with bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,620.55\nonce again failing to keep gains above $116,000 alongside continued selling by wallets of early adopters, or OGs.\n\nAccording to blockchain analyst Lookonchain, on Sunday an eight-year BTC holder moved 1,176 BTC worth over $136 million to Hyperliquid and started dumping. This holder is known to have exchanged 35,991 BTC for 886,731 ETH in recent months.\n\nOther long-term holders have also been liquidating coins in recent months as the market continues to adjust to a six-figure price as the new normal for BTC.\n\nBut the latest selling is not just limited to long-term holders. On-chain data tracked by Glassnode showed that wallets of all sizes are back to distributing coins.\n\nIn ether's case, whale wallets continue to scale exposure, suggesting ether outperformance relative to bitcoin. The ether-bitcoin ratio on Binance, however, fell for a third consecutive day, unable to capitalize on the descending trendline breakout confirmed on Friday.\n\nMemecoins, the recent outperformers, have also come under pressure, with top tokens, DOGE and SHIB, losing 10% and 6%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana's native token SOL traded over 2% lower at $234 despite key industry participants taking steps to accelerate the adoption of Solana-native decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nKyle Samani, chairman of Nasdaq-listed Solana treasury company Forward Industries, said on X that the company plans to deploy funds into the Solana-based DeFi protocols. Last week, Forward raised $1.65 billion in a private placement led by Multicoin Capital, Galaxy Digital and Jump Crypto.\n\nSamani was responding to an idea raised by a crypto trader, Ansem, who called for corporate treasury funds to invest in Solana-based DeFi to boost the network's DeFi appeal relative to industry giant Ethereum.\n\nIn traditional markets, investor positioning in the S&P 500 looked totally biased bullish. \"Sentiment is at extremes.

    "title": "Monero Suffers Deepest-Ever Blockchain Reorganization, Invalidating 118 Transactions",
    "content": "Monero’s blockchain experienced an 18-block reorganization on Sunday, its deepest to date, that effectively invalidated 118 confirmed transactions by rolling back 36 minutes of transaction history.\n\nThe reorg began at block height 3,499,659 when Qubic, a lesser-known AI-focused layer-1 blockchain, unleashed a longer chain that Monero’s network nodes accepted, orphaning the other chain’s previously confirmed blocks.\n\nThe move is the latest escalation in a campaign by Qubic, which last month acquired more than half of Monero’s mining power. Qubic leverages a “useful proof-of-work” (uPoW) model that repurposes XMR mining rewards and converts them into USDT, which is then used to buy back and burn QUBIC tokens.\n\nDespite the rollback, XMR’s price defied expectations, climbing to a two-month high of $333 after the attack, before seeing a slight drop to $307.5 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency is still up more than 6.4% in the last 24 hours, while its daily trading volume jumped 78% to $136 million.\n\n“Personally, I don’t consider the Monero network reliable at this point,” said Vini Barbosa, a crypto commentator on X, adding that he would stop accepting XMR payments until the issue is resolved.\n\n“In the last 720 blocks (~24h), 213 blocks have been orphaned (114 produced by known pools and 99 produced by unknown pools or solo miners). That's 29.5% of all blocks,” Vini added. “This is just too much.”\n\nThe attack may force the Monero community to make difficult decisions. One proposed solution involves using DNS checkpoints, trusted snapshots of the blockchain, to counteract future reorganizations.\n\nCritics argue this would compromise the network’s decentralization. On GitHub, crypto researcher Rucknium pointed out that the temporary rollout of DNS checkpoints is highly likely to soon be deployed.\n\nMore For You\n\nSolana's Jupiter to Develop JupUSD Stablecoin With Backing From Ethena Labs\n\nJupUSD will be developed in partnership with Ethana Labs and initially be fully collateralized by Ethana's USDtb stablecoin.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Fears of a downside for bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,602.57\nand ether\nETH\n$4,524.88\nhave eased substantially, according to the latest options market data. However, the pace of the next upward move in these cryptocurrencies will largely hinge on the magnitude of the anticipated Fed rate cut scheduled for Sept. 17.\n\nBTC's seven-day call/put skew, which measures how implied volatility is distributed across calls versus puts expiring in a week, has recovered to nearly zero from the bearish 4% a week ago, according to data source Amberdata.\n\nThe 30- and 60-day option skews, though still slightly negative, have rebounded from last week’s lows, signaling a notable easing of downside fears. Ether’s options skew is exhibiting a similar pattern at the time of writing.\n\nThe skew shows the market's directional bias, or the extent to which traders are more concerned about prices rising or falling. A positive skew suggests a bias towards calls or bullish option plays, while a negative reading indicates relatively higher demand for put options or downside protection.\n\nThe reset in options comes as bitcoin and ether prices see a renewed upswing in the lead-up to Wednesday's Fed rate decision, where the central bank is widely expected to cut rates and lay the groundwork for additional easing over the coming months. BTC has gained over 4% to over $116,000 in seven days, with ether rising nearly 8% to $4,650, according to CoinDesk data.\n\nWhat happens next largely depends on the size of the impending Fed rate cut. According to CME's Fed funds futures, traders have priced in over 90% probability that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 4%-4.25%. But there is also a slight possibility of a jumbo 50 bps move.\n\nBTC could go berserk in case the Fed delivers the surprise 50 bps move.\n\n\"A surprise 50 bps rate cut would be a massive +gamma BUY signal for ETH, SOL and BTC,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in an email. \"Gold will go absolutely nuts as well.\"\n\nNote that the Deribit-listed SOL options already exhibit a strong bullish sentiment, with calls trading at 4-5 volatility premium to puts.\n\nMagadini explained that if the decision comes in line with expectations for a 25 bps cut, then a continued calm \"grind higher\" for BTC looks likely. ETH, meanwhile, may take another week or so to retest all-time highs and convincingly trade above $5,000, he added.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Are the Record Flows for Traditional and Crypto ETFs Reducing the Power of the Fed?",
    "content": "Record-breaking flows into exchange-traded funds may be reshaping markets in ways that even the Federal Reserve can’t control.\n\nNew data show U.S.-listed ETFs have become a dominant force in capital markets. According to a Friday press release by ETFGI, an independent consultancy, assets invested in U.S. ETFs hit a record $12.19 trillion at the end of August, up from $10.35 trillion at the close of 2024. Bloomberg, which highlighted the surge on Friday, noted the flows are challenging the traditional influence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nInvestors poured $120.65 billion into ETFs during August alone, lifting year-to-date inflows to $799 billion — the highest on record. By comparison, the prior full-year record was $643 billion in 2024.\n\nThe growth is concentrated among the biggest providers. iShares leads with $3.64 trillion in assets, followed closely by Vanguard with $3.52 trillion and State Street’s SPDR family at $1.68 trillion.\n\nTogether, those three firms control nearly three-quarters of the U.S. ETF market. Equity ETFs drew the largest share of August inflows at $42 billion, while fixed-income funds added $32 billion and commodity ETFs nearly $5 billion.\n\nCrypto-linked ETFs are now a meaningful piece of the picture.\n\nData from SoSoValue show U.S.-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs manage more than $120 billion combined, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC). Bitcoin ETFs alone account for more than $100 billion, equal to about 4% of bitcoin’s $2.1 trillion market cap. Ether ETFs add another $20 billion, despite launching only earlier this year.\n\nThe surge underscores how ETFs — traditional and crypto alike — have become the vehicle of choice for investors of all sizes. For many, the flows are automatic.\n\nIn the U.S., much of the cash comes from retirement accounts known as 401(k)s, where workers put aside part of every paycheck.\n\nA growing share of that money goes into “target-date funds.” These funds automatically shift investments — moving gradually from stocks into bonds — as savers approach retirement age. Model portfolios and robo-advisers follow similar rules, automatically directing flows into ETFs without investors making day-to-day choices.\n\nBloomberg described this as an “autopilot” effect: every two weeks, millions of workers’ contributions are funneled into index funds that buy the same baskets of stocks, regardless of valuations, headlines or Fed policy. Analysts cited by Bloomberg say this steady demand helps explain why U.S. equity indexes keep climbing even as data on jobs and inflation show signs of strain.\n\nThe trend raises questions about the Fed’s influence.\n\nTraditionally, interest rate cuts or hikes sent strong signals that rippled through stocks, bonds, and commodities. Lower rates typically encouraged risk-taking, while higher rates reined it in. But with ETFs absorbing hundreds of billions of dollars on a set schedule, markets may be less sensitive to central bank cues.\n\nThat tension is especially clear this month. With the Fed expected to cut rates by a quarter point on Sept. 17, stocks sit near record highs and gold trades above $3,600 an ounce.\n\nBitcoin, meanwhile, is trading at around $116,000, not far from its all-time high of $124,000 set in mid August.\n\nStock, bond and crypto ETFs have seen strong inflows, suggesting investors are positioning for easier money — but also reflecting a structural tide of passive allocations.\n\nSupporters told Bloomberg the rise of ETFs has lowered costs and broadened access to markets. But critics quoted in the same report warn that the sheer scale of inflows could amplify volatility if redemptions cluster in a downturn, since ETFs move whole baskets of securities at once.\n\nAs Bloomberg put it, this “perpetual machine” of passive investing may be reshaping markets in ways that even the central bank struggles to counter.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin Bulls Bet on Fed Rate Cuts to Drive Bond Yields Lower, but There's a Catch",
    "content": "On Sept. 17, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the benchmark range to 4.00%-4.25%. This move will likely be followed by more easing in the coming months, taking the rates down to around 3% within the next 12 months. The fed funds futures market is discounting a drop in the fed funds rate to less than 3% by the end of 2026.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,599.88\nbulls are optimistic that the anticipated easing will push Treasury yields sharply lower, thereby encouraging increased risk-taking across both the economy and financial markets. However, the dynamics are more complex and could lead to outcomes that differ significantly from what is anticipated.\n\nWhile the expected Fed rate cuts could weigh on the two-year Treasury yield, those at the long end of the curve may remain elevated due to fiscal concerns and sticky inflation.\n\nThe U.S. government is expected to increase the issuance of Treasury bills (short-term instruments) and eventually longer-duration Treasury notes to finance the Trump administration's recently approved package of extended tax cuts and increased defense spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these policies are likely to add over $2.4 trillion to primary deficits over ten years, while Increasing debt by nearly $3 trillion, or roughly $5 trillion if made permanent.\n\nThe increased supply of debt will likely weigh on bond prices and lift yields. (bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction).\n\n\"The U.S. Treasury’s eventual move to issue more notes and bonds will pressure longer-term yields higher,\" analysts at T. Rowe Price, a global investment management firm, said in a recent report.\n\nFiscal concerns have already permeated the longer-duration Treasury notes, where investors are demanding higher yields to lend money to the government for 10 years or more, known as the term premium.\n\nThe ongoing steepening of the yield curve – which is reflected in the widening spread between 10- and 2-year yields, as well as 30- and 5-year yields and driven primarily by the relative resilience of long-term rates – also signals increasing concerns about fiscal policy.\n\nKathy Jones, managing director and chief income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, voiced a similar opinion this month, noting that \"investors are demanding a higher yield for long-term Treasuries to compensate for the risk of inflation and/or depreciation of the dollar as a consequence of high debt levels.\"\n\nThese concerns could keep long-term bond yields from falling much, Jones added.\n\nSince the Fed began cutting rates last September, the U.S. labor market has shown signs of significant weakening, bolstering expectations for a quicker pace of Fed rate cuts and a decline in Treasury yields. However, inflation has recently edged higher, complicating that outlook.\n\nWhen the Fed cut rates in September last year, the year-on-year inflation rate was 2.4%. Last month, it stood at 2.9%, the highest since January's 3% reading. In other words, inflation has regained momentum, weakening the case for faster Fed rate cuts and a drop in Treasury yields.\n\nYields have already come under pressure, likely reflecting the market’s anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\nThe 10-year yield slipped to 4% last week, hitting the lowest since April 8, according to data source TradingView. The benchmark yield has dropped over 60 basis points from its May high of 4.62%.\n\nAccording to Padhraic Garvey, CFA, regional head of research, Americas at ING, the drop to 4% is likely an overshoot to the downside.\n\n\"We can see the 10yr Treasury yield targeting still lower as an attack on 4% is successful. But that's likely an overshoot to the downside. Higher inflation prints in the coming months will likely cause long-end yields some issues, requiring a significant adjustment,\" Garvey said in a note to clients last week.\n\nPerhaps rate cuts have been priced in, and yields could bounce back hard following the Sept. 17 move, in a repeat of the 2024 pattern. The dollar index suggests the same, as noted early this week.\n\nThe 10-year yield fell by over 100 basis points to 3.60% in roughly five months leading up to the September 2024 rate cut.\n\nThe central bank delivered additional rate cuts in November and December. Yet, the 10-year yield bottomed out with the September move and rose to 4.57% by year-end, eventually reaching a high of 4.80% in January of this year.\n\nAccording to ING, the upswing in yields following the easing was driven by economic resilience, sticky inflation, and fiscal concerns.\n\nAs of today, while the economy has weakened, inflation and fiscal concerns have worsened as discussed earlier, which means the 2024 pattern could repeat itself.\n\nWhile BTC rallied from $70,000 to over $100,000 between October and December 2024 despite rising long-term yields, this surge was primarily fueled by optimism around pro-crypto regulatory policies under President Trump and growing corporate adoption of BTC and other tokens.\n\nHowever, these supporting narratives have significantly weakened looking back a year later. Consequently, the possibility of a potential hardening of yields in the coming months weighing over bitcoin cannot be dismissed.\n\nRead: Here Are the 3 Things That Could Spoil Bitcoin's Rally Towards $120K\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It measures the strength of accumulation for each balance size based on both the entities’ size and the volume of coins acquired over the past 15 days. (For more details on the methodology, see this Academy entry.)\n\nExchanges, miners and other similar entities are excluded from the calculation.\n\nCurrently, all cohorts, from wallets holding less than one bitcoin to those holding more than 10,000, are net sellers. This follows last week’s rally, when some whales — most notably the 10-100 BTC and 1,000-10,000 BTC cohorts were buying. They have since flipped back to selling.\n\nBitcoin was recently hovering near $117,000 after Asia’s trading session pushed it up from $115,000 dollars over the weekend. Over the past three months, Asia has consistently driven bitcoin roughly 10 percent higher, according to Velo data.

    "content": "In answer to Wall Street bank lobbying, crypto group Stand With Crypto said it enlisted its online members to send a message more than 250,000 times to the U.S. senators in their states, pushing back on the bankers' attempt to stymie the avenue for stablecoin rewards in the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.\n\nThe letter crafted by Stand With Crypto — a U.S. pro-crypto member organization initially established by Coinbase — urges lawmakers to ignore the banking advocates who launched an August effort to rewrite the law to completely shutter stablecoin issuers' ability to offer yields to users.\n\n\"Lawmakers chose to protect rewards because you know they are for consumers,\" according to the form letter set up to be automatically sent to politicians in each member's state if the member chooses to execute it. \"A ban on rewards would stop consumers from earning value on fully backed digital dollars, even as banks lobbied to protect their credit card rewards as recently as last year.\"\n\nThe GENIUS Act, which became law earlier this year and is already in the midst of adoption by federal regulators, blocks stablecoin issuers from offering interest or yield directly, but it doesn't stop the issuers' affiliates or exchanges from doing so. As a result, the bankers have argued there could be a massive loss of deposits and money-market fund activity as this rivalry from stablecoins emerges.\n\n\"Congress must protect the flow of credit to American businesses and families and the stability of the most important financial market by closing the stablecoin payment of interest loophole,\" groups including the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Financial Services Forum and others argued in their own campaign.\n\nCrypto lobbyists had quickly responded to the bankers, seeking to protect the GENIUS Act — the first major crypto law approved in the U.S.\n\nWhile the U.S. Treasury Department and other financial regulators have said they've begun trying to implement the stablecoin law, their workers who would be crafting those regulations are largely derailed from that effort at the moment. The U.S. government is mostly closed because of a budgetary shutdown as Congress let the federal spending plan lapse and hasn't yet agreed on a way forward.\n\nStand With Crypto reports more than 2.7 million crypto fans have signed up with the organization.\n\nMore For You\n\nBank of England Plans Exemptions to Stablecoin Limits: Bloomberg\n\nThe BoE will grant waivers to some businesses like crypto exchanges that need to hold large amounts of the tokens.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Shayne Coplan, founder and CEO of the blockchain-based prediction market Polymarket, has become the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe milestone follows Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) announcing Tuesday that it would invest as much as $2 billion in the company at an $8 billion pre-money valuation. ICE owns the New York Stock Exchange, one of the world’s most powerful financial institutions.\n\nCoplan, now 27, launched Polymarket in June 2020 after spending a year studying how prediction markets could improve decision-making. The platform lets users wager on real-world outcomes, from elections to sports to economic indicators, using cryptocurrency.\n\nPolymarket’s breakout moment came during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, when users wagered more than $3 billion on potential outcomes. The scale of participation turned Coplan’s idea from a niche crypto experiment into a global phenomenon.\n\nBut the rise wasn’t without setbacks. In 2022, Polymarket paid a $1.4 million penalty to settle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over allegations it was offering illegal trading. The company said it blocked U.S. users soon after, though regulators later suspected it still hosted American traders. One week after the 2024 election, FBI agents raided Coplan’s apartment. The Justice Department dropped the investigation in July, as did the CFTC's civil investigation.\n\nThat same month, Polymarket acquired QCEX, a CFTC-licensed exchange and clearinghouse, giving it legal grounds to operate in the United States. The move marked a sharp turn from its early regulatory troubles to full legitimacy under U.S. law.\n\nPolymarket has since reshaped the gambling and financial forecasting industries. By blending blockchain transparency with the thrill of market-driven prediction, it’s attracting both retail and institutional interest.\n\nRival platforms have taken notice. Kalshi, another prediction-market operator, began offering bets through a partnership with Robinhood Markets earlier this year.\n\nMore For You\n\nSquare Launches Bitcoin Payment Tools for Small Businesses\n\nThe features allow U.S. sellers to accept BTC, convert fiat sales automatically and manage crypto alongside traditional finances.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Uranium.io Shakes Up Uranium Market With Launch of Real-Time Price Oracle",
    "content": "The crypto industry is not just about ETFs and price surges; it's also about tackling real-world market inefficiencies. The launch of Uranium.io's near-real-time uranium pricing oracle is a prime example of that.\n\nUranium.io, a platform tokenizing Uranium, unveiled its pricing oracle on Tuesday, aimed at addressing the price opacity issues in the uranium market.\n\nUnlike oil, gold, base metals and agri commodities, uranium pricing has long relied on over-the-counter deals – privately negotiated and fragmented transactions that leave market participants in the dark. This absence of a reliable real-time market action gauge has bred inefficiencies and uncertainty, limiting broad-based participation in the market.\n\nUranium.io's oracle changes the game by aggregating data from dozens of market sources, including spot price feeds, nuclear-sector equities, commodity funds, and related assets.\n\nThe proprietary system uses sophisticated algorithms to update uranium spot price estimates every 60 seconds, providing an almost live pricing engine that mirrors the complex dynamics of uranium fluctuations.\n\n\"While uranium itself trades privately, its value is constantly being priced in public markets through related assets like uranium ETFs, mining stocks, and specialized funds. Our oracle uses statistical modeling to synthesize these pricing signals into a near-real-time uranium spot price estimate. It's similar to how other commodity benchmarks work, aggregating signals from related markets to create reliable price references,\" Ben Elvidge, Head of Commercial Applications at Trilitech and the Product Lead for Uranium.io, told CoinDesk.\n\nUranium.io is a blockchain-based project that aims to democratize the uranium market. The platform enables individual and institutional investors to trade and own fractional shares of physical uranium (U₃O₈), also known as \"yellow cake,\" providing transparent access to a market traditionally dominated by large institutions.\n\nEach xU308 token is backed by real, physical uranium stored in a regulated facility operated by Cameco, which is the world's largest publicly traded uranium company, based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.\n\nThe tokenization process begins once the physical uranium is verified and registered on the Tezos blockchain, including its physical properties, storage locations and regulatory approvals. A smart contract is then deployed to represent the uranium asset digitally on the blockchain, after which tokens are minted.\n\nArthur Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, stated that the pricing oracle will initiate the virtuous cycle of injecting efficient pricing information into the market, thereby enhancing liquidity and market efficiency.\n\n\"Price discovery for uranium isn't just happening in the uranium spot markets but across a wide array of economically related assets. The oracle starts a virtuous circle by injecting this information back into the uranium market, which in turn can improve its liquidity and foster better price discovery in the spot market,\" Brietman said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nWhile individual investors typically cannot own physical uranium, they have gained exposure through financial instruments such as uranium futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have provided significantly higher returns than bitcoin this year.\n\nFor instance, the Global Uranium ETF (URA) has surged by 71% this year, outperforming notable ETFs like BlackRock's bitcoin ETF, IBIT, which has gained 27%, showcasing the growing investor interest and strong performance potential in uranium-related assets.\n\nThe global uranium market has traditionally been fragmented and restricted, particularly for retail investors who face significant barriers to directly holding physical uranium.\n\nThis is largely due to uranium's association with nuclear weapons and strict regulatory controls. However, uranium remains a critical element at the heart of the clean energy transition, powering nuclear reactors that provide low-carbon electricity globally.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin Rebounds Above $123K as Miners Rally; VanEck Sees $644K BTC Amid Gold Gains\n\nThe gold rally may need to cool before bitcoin could really gain momentum, suggested another analyst.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks a basket of major digital assets, rose 2%.\n\nLooking at crypto-related stocks, BTC miners tied to high-performance computing infrastructure once again led gains. Cipher Mining (CIFR) and Bitfarms (BITF) jumped 11%–12%, while CleanSpark (CLSK) and Hut 8 (HUT) added around 6%. The gains build on optimism that artificial intelligence-driven demand for computing power will benefit crypto miners.\n\nMeanwhile, minutes from the September Federal Reserve meeting released on Wednesday showed most officials still anticipate interest rate cuts later this year. Some policymakers, however, argued a cut wasn’t necessary in September, and the majority emphasized upside risks to inflation.\n\nDespite the crypto bounce, gold continues to lead the \"debasement trade,\" surging past $4,000 and now up 50% this year.\n\nThe rally is fueled by rising government deficits, shaky bond markets and expectations of looser monetary policy. Japanese yields hit 17-year highs this week, adding to global investor anxiety and sending capital toward gold as a safe haven—at the expense of risk assets like crypto.\n\nCharlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree, said gold’s rally isn’t being driven by speculation.\n\n\"The market is hot, but it’s not red hot,\" he said. \"If deficits, money printing, instability and rate cuts are driving the gold price higher, perhaps those things need to change before we turn bearish.\"\n\n“Gold will make an intermediate peak at some point, but it’s best not to guess when that is and wait for evidence,” he added.\n\nBitcoin, he argued, could be the next asset to catch a bid once gold's shine fades, pointing to the largest crypto’s historical role as a second-wave beneficiary in macro-driven risk rotations.\n\n\"When gold starts to cool, the chances are that bitcoin will get going again,\" Morris said.\n\nMatthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, reiterated in his long-term outlook that bitcoin could eventually capture half the market size of gold.\n\nThat scenario, he explained in a Tuesday X post, hinges on bitcoin as a \"digital gold\" being a more appealing store of value for younger generations.\n\nWith the latest gold gains, that projection would imply a $644,000 per BTC price, he said.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nStellar (XLM) Rebounds Sharply as Institutional Interest Fuels Recovery Momentum\n\nXLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Community participation was strong, fueled in part by the anticipation of $ZKC token rewards.\n\nWith Monday’s mainnet launch, those capabilities are now operational at scale. The team behind Boundless says it can deliver verifiable compute across chains, enabling developers to build applications that preserve privacy while scaling seamlessly between ecosystems.\n\nSome key protocols have started to integrate Boundless into their systems. Wormhole is integrating Boundless to add ZK verification to Ethereum consensus, making cross-chain transfers more secure.\n\nBOB, a hybrid Bitcoin rollup, is tapping Boundless to allow EVM applications to interoperate with Bitcoin using proofs that inherit Bitcoin’s security while drawing on Ethereum’s liquidity. And staking protocol Lido is deploying Boundless to secure validator exits with transparent proofs, strengthening trust and auditability for its crypto assets.\n\n“For the first time, developers on any chain can access abundant zero-knowledge compute to build complex applications that scale across ecosystems without sacrificing decentralization,” said Shiv Shankar, the CEO of Boundless.\n\nRead more: Risc Zero’s 'Boundless' Incentivized Testnet Goes Live\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "content": "Boundless, the decentralized zero-knowledge (ZK) compute marketplace powered by RISC Zero, has launched its incentivized testnet (which it is calling “Mainnet Beta”) on Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network.\n\nWith Boundless’ incentivized testnet, developers can build and test applications in an environment as if the protocol is in fully live format. The network has already landed early support from industry heavyweights like the Ethereum Foundation, Wormhole and EigenLayer.\n\nA decentralized marketplace for zero-knowledge compute connects those who need zero-knowledge proofs — such as developers building rollups, bridges, or privacy-preserving applications — with a distributed network of independent “ZK provers or miners” who generate and verify those proofs. Instead of relying on centralized parties, this model allows anyone with the right hardware to contribute computing power and be rewarded for doing that cryptographic work.\n\nZero-knowledge (ZK) technology allows parties to prove that a transaction is valid without revealing sensitive details like identities or amounts. ZK proofs are widely seen as crucial to the next generation of privacy and scaling focused blockchain projects.\n\nThe network relies on a Proof of Verifiable Work (PoVW) consensus mechanism. “PoVW is an open proving market where ZK miners, like institutions and individuals with high-performance GPUs, are rewarded for successfully verifying proofs,\" the team wrote in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “Unlike traditional Proof of Work, miners get rewarded for verification within a ZK Virtual Machine, ensuring efficiency, fairness, and security.”\n\nIn addition, those who will participate in the incentivized testnet will be able to earn early allocations of the network’s forthcoming token, $ZKC, with an airdrop event planned for later this year. Rewards are distributed based on the volume, speed, and complexity of proofs generated.\n\nThe team also shared that the network’s real mainnet is planned for the third quarter of 2025, with the token going live then too.\n\n“Boundless makes blockchains more scalable by allowing secure, cross-chain computing without repeating the same tasks. This boosts efficiency, strengthens security, and lets developers and miners join in across different ecosystems,” said Shiv Shankar, the CEO of Boundless, in the press release.\n\nRead more: Blockchain Capital Leads $40M Round for Crypto Firm RISC Zero\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "content": "Shiba Inu’s layer-2 network, Shibarium, was hit by a coordinated exploit that saw an attacker use a flash loan to gain control over a validator, drain assets from its bridge and trigger a temporary shutdown of staking operations.\n\nThe attacker, according to Shibarium developer Kaal Dhariya, bought 4.6 million BONE, the governance token of Shiba Inu’s layer-2 network, using a flash loan. The attacker then gained access to validator signing keys to achieve the majority validator power.\n\nWith that power, the attacker signed a fraudulent network state and siphoned assets from the Shibarium bridge, which connects it to the Ethereum network.\n\nSince the BONE is still staked and subject to an unstaking delay, the funds remain locked, giving developers a narrow window to respond and freeze the funds, Dhariya said.\n\nThe Shibarium team has now paused all stake and unstake functionality, moved remaining funds into a hardware wallet protected by a 6-of-9 multisig setup and launched an internal investigation.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether the breach stemmed from a compromised server or a developer machine. While total losses haven’t been advanced, transaction data suggests they’re near $3 million.\n\nThe team is working with security firms Hexens, Seal 911 and PeckShield, and has alerted law enforcement. But developers also extended a peace offering to the attacker.\n\n“Authorities have been contacted. However, we are open to negotiating in good faith with the attacker: if the funds are returned, we will not press any charges and are willing to consider a small bounty,” Dhariya wrote on X.\n\nThe price of BONE jumped immediately after the attack and at one point saw its value more than double, before a correction saw it move to a gain of around 40% since the exploit.

    "content": "The memecoin sector is heating up as fresh altcoin season talks are starting to grow on social media, partly driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve will this coming week cut interest rates, a boon for risk assets.\n\nBitcoin’s market dominance has dropped 3.5% in the past month, and its underperformance relative to altcoins has now seen altcoin season indexes, which measure the performance of top cryptocurrencies against BTC, enter “altseason” territory.\n\nAltseason, short for altcoin season, refers to a period in which alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform bitcoin. It often starts as capital rotates out of bitcoin amid growing risk appetite.\n\nThose include indexes from CoinMarketCap and CoinGlass. Over the last 24 hours bitcoin moved up just 0.3%, while the CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME) rose 7.1%.\n\nPushing up prices in the CDMEME index are some tokens like SHIB and BONE, which recently puzzlingly surged after Shiba Inu’s layer-2 network Shibarium suffered a flash loan exploit.\n\nThe growing performance of altcoins stems from growing risk appetite, as lowering interest rates makes safer investments like government bonds less appealing. This renewed risk appetite is fueling a cascading rotation of capital across markets.\n\nTraders on prediction market Polymarket now see a 92% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 basis points this month, and a 7% chance that rate will be 50 bps. On the CME’s FedWatch tool, odds of a smaller cut are at 93%, while odds of a larger cut are at 6.6%.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a wave of altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is in line to hit U.S. markets in the last quarter of the year if these are approved. These even include a DOGE ETF and a TRUMP ETF.\n\nIf approved, these ETFs could bring more retail and institutional investors into the altcoin space by offering regulated access to cryptocurrencies beyond BTC and ETH, whose spot ETFs in the U.S. have amassed billions in assets.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin Rebounds Above $123K as Miners Rally; VanEck Sees $644K BTC Amid Gold Gains\n\nThe gold rally may need to cool before bitcoin could really gain momentum, suggested another analyst.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "State of Crypto: Brian Quintenz v. Tyler Winklevoss",
    "content": "CFTC Chair nominee Brian Quintenz posted several messages he'd exchanged with Tyler Winklevoss, seemingly in a bid to get his nomination process back on track.\n\nYou’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.\n\nOn Wednesday, at CoinDesk's Policy and Regulation event, one major topic of conversation was a post from former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Brian Quintenz in which he shared chat logs from a conversation with Gemini co-founder and CEO Tyler Winklevoss, an unexpected move from a former public official waiting for the Senate to confirm him to head up the commodities regulator.\n\nQuintenz's path to becoming chair of the CFTC seemed clear until late July, when the Senate Agriculture Committee twice postponed a key vote to advance his nomination. The White House asked the committee to pause the vote without initially providing an explanation, though later Winklevoss told CoinDesk he had lobbied the White House to impose that hold. The CFTC is set to become the primary spot market regulator for crypto in the U.S., and is currently helmed by Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who intends to depart the agency after Quintenz's nomination and no other commissioners. The potential lack of leadership as the agency gets tasked with new mandates could slow down or otherwise complicate any rulemakings it engages in.\n\nAn active nominee awaiting a Senate vote sharing an exchange he had with donors to the president is unusual, to say the least. In his post, Quintenz said he had \"never been inclined to release private messages\" but that he believed President Donald Trump \"might have been misled.\"\n\n\"I've posted here the messages that include the questions Tyler Winklevoss asked me pertaining to their prior litigation with the CFTC,\" he said. \"I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It's my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.\"\n\nThe texts he shared showed he had exchanged messages with Winklevoss on July 24 and 25. The first postponed vote in the Senate Agriculture Committee was originally scheduled for July 21, and the rescheduled vote was on July 28. The White House requested at least the second vote be delayed.\n\nSpokespeople for Gemini and the Senate Agriculture Committee did not return requests for comment, and a White House press official could not be reached. Quintenz declined to comment beyond his post when reached earlier this week by CoinDesk.\n\nThe messages were about Gemini's complaint with the CFTC's Inspector General tied to a CFTC case against the exchange, which was settled earlier this year. Winklevoss asked Quintenz for his thoughts on the complaint, while Quintenz repeatedly said it would be better for \"a fully confirmed chair\" to weigh in on the matter.\n\nIt's unclear from the messages whether Winklevoss was asking for a quid pro quo (he mentioned that Quintenz had asked for an endorsement) or was just trying to confirm to his own satisfaction that Quintenz would end what Winklevoss described as \"lawfare\" against Gemini and otherwise reshape the agency to be more industry-friendly.\n\nOn Quintenz's end, his reticence was likely political savvines — if he had made some form of commitment, he may have had to recuse himself from engaging with the issue when he actually gets to the agency. If he made a commitment and it became public prior to a Senate vote, it would also probably become a talking point if there is a debate on his nomination. Quintenz also said in the messages that he did not have \"anything close to a full picture of what is going on inside the building,\" and that he \"decided to wait until I can get into the role to get that view as opposed to trying to get it now through current leadership.\"\n\nThe timing of Quintenz's confirmation votes — he needs both the Senate Agriculture Committee to advance him and the entire Senate to confirm him — remain in question. But it's a sign of how much that process has slowed that he felt posting these messages would help his cause.\n\nMonday\n\nIf you’ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you’d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Bluesky @nikhileshde.bsky.social.\n\nYou can also join the group conversation on Telegram.\n\nSee ya’ll next week!\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Corporate Bitcoin Buying Slowed in August as Treasuries Add $5B",
    "content": "Bitcoin’s rally lost momentum in August, and slowing corporate accumulation may explain why.\n\nTracked treasury entities added 47,718 BTC last month ($5.2 billion), down from more than 100,000 BTC in July, according to the latest Bitcoin Treasuries Adoption Report. That brought total holdings across public companies, private firms, governments and ETFs to 3.68 million BTC, valued at $400 billion at month-end. The monthly increase of 1.2% was far weaker than July’s 4.6%.\n\nThis easing in BTC acquisitions by corporate entities could offer an explanation for BTC's rally to $123,000 not being sustained. Bitcoin hit an all-time high in mid August, but fell over 11.5% by the end of the month to sit below $109,000.\n\nThe slowdown came despite aggressive fundraising announcements. More than $15 billion in equity raises were outlined by treasury firms including Strategy (MSTR), KindlyMD (NAKA) and Metaplanet (3350). Those commitments have yet to translate into immediate purchases, leaving a gap between fundraising headlines and actual market impact.\n\nEven with the softer pace, August saw important milestones. Public company holdings crossed the 1 million BTC threshold for the first time, doubling from late 2024, according to the report.\n\nAmong individual firms, healthcare company KindlyMD made the second-largest buy of the month with a 5,744 BTC purchase worth $679 million. Japan’s Metaplanet added 1,859 BTC across four different transactions.\n\nCrypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) also joining the treasury rankings after its August IPO. The firm revealed it has held 24,000 BTC since March, valued at $2.6 billion at the end of August. CEO Tom Farley described the company’s strategy as part of an ongoing institutional wave, telling CNBC it “feels like institutional investors think this could be the moment.\" The exchange's parent company Bullish Global is also the owner of CoinDesk.\n\nDespite those high-profile moves, the aggregate value of tracked treasuries fell from $428 billion in July to $400 billion in August as bitcoin’s price eased to $108,695 by the end of the month.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin Rebounds Above $123K as Miners Rally; VanEck Sees $644K BTC Amid Gold Gains\n\nThe gold rally may need to cool before bitcoin could really gain momentum, suggested another analyst.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "GPU Gold Rush: Why Bitcoin Miners Are Powering AI’s Expansion",
    "content": "When Core Scientific signed a $3.5 billion deal to host artificial intelligence (AI) data centers earlier this year, it wasn’t chasing the next crypto token — it was chasing a steadier paycheck. Once known for its vast fleets of bitcoin mining rigs, the company is now part of a growing trend: converting energy-intensive mining operations into high-performance AI facilities.\n\nBitcoin miners like Core, Hut 8 (HUT) and TeraWulf (WULF) are swapping ASIC machines — the dedicated bitcoin mining computer — for GPU clusters, driven by the lure of AI’s explosive growth and the harsh economics of crypto mining.\n\nIt's no secret that bitcoin mining requires an extensive amount of energy, which is the biggest cost of minting a new digital asset.\n\nBack in the 2021 bull run, when the Bitcoin network's hashrate and difficulty were low, miners were making out like bandits with margins as much as 90%. Then came the brutal crypto winter and the halving event, which slashed the mining reward in half. In 2025, with surging hashrate and energy prices, miners are now struggling to survive with razor-thin margins.\n\nHowever, the need for power—the biggest input cost—became a blessing in disguise for these miners, who needed a different strategy to diversify their revenue sources.\n\nDue to rising competition for mining, the miners continued to procure more machines to stay afloat, and with it came the need for more megawatts of electricity at a cheaper price. Miners invested heavily in securing these low-cost energy sources, such as hydroelectric or stranded natural gas sites, and developed expertise in managing high-density cooling and electrical systems—skills honed during the crypto boom of the early 2020s.\n\nThis is what captured the attention of AI and cloud computing firms. While bitcoin relies on specialized ASICs, AI thrives on versatile GPUs like Nvidia's H100 series, which require similar high-power environments but for parallel processing tasks in machine learning. Instead of building out data centers from scratch, taking over mining infrastructure, which already has power ready, became a faster way to grow an increasing appetite for AI-related infrastructure.\n\nEssentially, these miners aren’t just pivoting—they’re retrofitting.\n\nThe cooling systems, low-cost energy contracts, and power-dense infrastructure they built during the crypto boom now serve a new purpose: feeding the AI models of companies like OpenAI and Google.\n\nFirms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers.\n\nBitcoin mining has effectively \"terraformed\" the terrain for AI compute by building out scalable, power-efficient infrastructure that AI desperately needs.\n\nAs Nicholas Gregory, Board Director at Fragrant Prosperity, noted, \"It can be argued bitcoin paved the way for digital dollar payments as can be seen with USDT/Tether. It also looks like bitcoin terraformed data centres for AI/GPU compute.\"\n\nThis pre-existing \"terraforming\" allows miners to retrofit facilities quickly, often in under a year, compared to the multi-year timelines for traditional data center builds. Firms like Crusoe Energy sold off mining assets to focus solely on AI, deploying GPU clusters in remote, energy-rich locations that mirror the decentralized ethos of crypto but now fuel centralized AI hyperscalers.\n\nIn practice, it means miners can flip a facility in less than a year—far faster than the multi-year timeline of a new data center.\n\nBut AI isn’t a cheap upgrade.\n\nBitcoin mining setups are relatively modest, with costs ranging from $300,000 to $800,000 per megawatt (MW) excluding ASICs, allowing for quick scalability in response to market cycles. Meanwhile, AI infrastructure demands significantly higher capex due to the need for advanced liquid cooling, redundant power systems, and the GPUs themselves, which can cost tens of thousands per unit and face global supply shortages. Despite the steeper upfront costs, AI offers miners up to 25 times more revenue per kilowatt-hour than bitcoin mining, making the pivot economically compelling amid rising energy prices and declining crypto profitability.\n\nAs AI continues to surge and crypto profits tighten, bitcoin mining could become a niche game—one reserved for energy-rich regions or highly efficient players, especially as the next in 2028 could render many operations unprofitable without breakthroughs in efficiency or energy costs.\n\nWhile projections show the global crypto mining market growing to $3.3 billion by 2030, at a modest 6.9% CAGR, the billions would be overshadowed by AI's exponential expansion. According to KBV Research, the global AI in mining market is projected to reach $435.94 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.6%.\n\nWith investors already seeing dollar signs in this shift, the broader trend suggests the future is either a hybrid or a full conversion to AI, where stable contracts with hyperscalers promise longevity over crypto's boom-bust cycles.\n\nThis evolution not only repurposes idle assets but also underscores how yesterday's crypto frontiers are forging tomorrow's AI empires.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin Climbs as Economy Cracks — Is it Bullish or Bearish?",
    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$111,480.33\nis about 4% higher than it was a week ago—good news for the digital asset but bad news for the economy.\n\nThe recent negative tone of the economic data points from last week raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates on Wednesday, making riskier assets such as stocks and bitcoin more attractive.\n\nLet's recap the data that backs up that thesis.\n\nThe most important one, the U.S. CPI figures, came out on Thursday. The headline rate was slightly higher than expected, a sign inflation might be stickier than anticipated.\n\nBefore that, we had Tuesday's revisions to job data. The world's largest economy created almost 1 million fewer jobs than reported in the year ended March, the largest downward revision in the country's history.\n\nThe figures followed the much-watched monthly jobs report, which was released the previous Friday. The U.S. added just 22,000 jobs in August, with unemployment rising to 4.3%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Initial jobless claims rose 27,000 to 263,000 — the highest since October 2021.\n\nHigher inflation and fewer jobs are not great for the U.S. economy, so it's no surprise that the word \"stagflation\" is starting to creep back into macroeconomic commentary.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, bitcoin—considered a risk asset by Wall Street—continued grinding higher, topping $116,000 on Friday and almost closing the CME futures gap at 117,300 from August.\n\nNot a surprise, as traders are also bidding up the biggest risk assets: equities. Just take a look at the S&P 500 index, which closed at a record for the second day on the hope of a rate cut.\n\nSo how should traders think about BTC's price chart?\n\nTo this chart enthusiast, price action remains constructive, with higher lows forming from the September bottom of $107,500. The 200-day moving average has climbed to $102,083, while the Short-Term Holder Realized Price — often used as support in bull markets — rose to a record $109,668.\n\nHowever, bitcoin's weekly positive price action didn't help Strategy (MSTR), the largest of the bitcoin treasury companies, whose shares were about flat for the week. Its rivals performed better: MARA Holdings (MARA) 7% and XXI (CEP) 4%.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) has underperformed bitcoin year-to-date and continues to hover below its 200-day moving average, currently $355. At Thursday's close of $326, it's testing a key long-term support level seen back in September 2024 and April 2025.\n\nThe company’s mNAV premium has compressed to below 1.5x when accounting for outstanding convertible debt and preferred stock, or roughly 1.3x based solely on equity value.\n\nPreferred stock issuance remains muted, with only $17 million tapped across STRK and STRF this week, meaning that the bulk of at-the-money issuance is still flowing through common shares. According to the company, options are now listed and trading for all four perpetual preferred stocks, a development that could provide additional yield on the dividend.\n\nThe CME's FedWatch tool shows traders expect a 25 basis-point U.S. interest-rate cut in September and have priced in a total of three rate cuts by year-end.\n\nThat's a sign risk sentiment could tilt back toward growth and crypto-linked equities, underlined by the 10-year U.S. Treasury briefly breaking below 4% this week.\n\nStill, the dollar index (DXY) continues to hold multiyear support, a potential inflection point worth watching.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Gemini Crypto Exchange IPO Pops 14% as Winklevoss Twins Predict $1M Bitcoin",
    "content": "Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, surged in its Nasdaq debut Friday after raising $425 million in an initial public offering.\n\nThe company priced its IPO late Thursday at $28 a share, valuing Gemini at about $3.3 billion before trading began. That price was above the revised $24 to $26 range it set earlier in the week and well above the initial $17 to $19 range. The offering covered 15.2 million shares.\n\nOn Friday, the stock opened at $37.01, a 32% premium to the offer price. Shares climbed as high as $45.89 during intraday trading before settling at $32, still 14% above the IPO level by the close.\n\nGemini, headquartered in New York, operates a suite of crypto services including a spot exchange, custody solutions for institutions, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, a crypto rewards credit card, and staking products.

    "title": "‘Crypto’s Time Has Come’: SEC Chair Outlines Vision for On-Chain Markets and Agentic Finance",
    "content": "U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said crypto’s time has come, pledging to modernize the U.S. securities rulebook and expand “Project Crypto” to bring markets on-chain.\n\nSpeaking in Paris on Sept. 10 at the OECD’s inaugural Roundtable on Global Financial Markets, Atkins said the SEC is shifting away from enforcement-driven policymaking and will provide clear rules for tokens, custody, and trading platforms. “Policy will no longer be set by ad hoc enforcement actions,” he said, calling the new approach “a golden age of financial innovation on U.S. soil.”\n\nAtkins said most tokens are not securities and promised bright-line rules for determining when crypto assets fall under SEC oversight. He said entrepreneurs must be able to raise capital on-chain without “endless legal uncertainty” and pledged a framework for platforms that integrate trading, lending, and staking under one license. Custody rules will also be updated to allow investors and intermediaries multiple options.\n\nThe SEC chair said Project Crypto would clear the way for tokenized securities, new on-chain asset classes, and decentralized finance software, while ensuring investor protections. He also highlighted the potential for “super-app” trading platforms and stressed the importance of keeping innovation in the United States.\n\nAtkins first unveiled Project Crypto on July 31, 2025, in Washington, framing it as the SEC’s “north star” in supporting President Trump’s goal of making the U.S. the world’s crypto hub. His Paris remarks expanded on that agenda, outlining more details on custody, capital formation, and platform rules.\n\nAtkins’ remarks came two days after Nasdaq President Tal Cohen posted on LinkedIn that tokenization is an “extraordinary opportunity” for global markets. Cohen said Nasdaq had filed with the SEC to enable trading of tokenized securities, underscoring how major institutions are moving toward blockchain adoption.\n\nBeyond crypto, Atkins addressed foreign company listings, accounting standards, and European regulation. He raised concerns over “double materiality” in EU reporting laws, urged stable funding for the IASB, and said the SEC may revisit its 2007 decision to allow IFRS without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP if funding issues persist.\n\nThe SEC chair also highlighted artificial intelligence as a force that could fundamentally reshape financial markets. He described a shift toward “agentic finance,” where autonomous AI systems could execute trades, allocate capital, and manage risk at speeds no human can match, with compliance embedded directly into their code.\n\nSuch systems, he said, could deliver faster and cheaper markets while opening advanced strategies to a broader set of investors. Coupled with blockchain infrastructure, these tools could empower individuals, increase competition, and unlock new growth.\n\nAtkins cautioned, however, that regulators must provide “commonsense guardrails” without overreacting out of fear. He argued that on-chain capital markets and AI-driven finance are on the horizon, and that America must choose leadership to ensure the next generation of financial innovation takes root at home.\n\nAtkins concluded by saying regulators must strike a balance between innovation and investor protection. “Crypto’s time has come,” he said, adding that U.S. markets should lead the next wave of financial innovation rather than watching it unfold overseas.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Your Company Probably Doesn’t Need Its Own L2",
    "content": "More and more companies are attracted to the idea of launching their own Ethereum layer 2 network. Most of them shouldn’t bother. There’s already a staggering number of them — over 150. Quite a few of these are centralized and linked to a single enterprise and several companies such as Robinhood have recently announced plans to launch their own layer 2 networks.\n\nThe attractions for launching an Ethereum layer 2 network are significant, especially when compared to launching your own layer 1 (foundation layer) blockchain. Layer 1 networks must compete with networks like Ethereum and Solana in an already intensely competitive and crowded market. Layer 2 networks that run on top of Ethereum also face an intensely competitive marketplace but can simultaneously draw upon the strength of the Ethereum ecosystem, thanks to deep integration into Ethereum itself.\n\nWith Ethereum having turned 10 in July, it remains the dominant smart contract blockchain and it is the largest single home for digital assets, real-world assets (RWA), stablecoins and decentralized finance applications. Ethereum’s share of the overall decentralized finance ecosystem has been stable at about 50% for three years now. When layer 2 networks are included in the total, it appears to be rising modestly.\n\nThe temptation to launch your own Ethereum layer 2 network is easy to understand — they look like a useful concept with great economics. A layer 2 network on top of Ethereum offers a bit of “best of both worlds” functionality: you can control your own ecosystem within your layer 2 but retain integration with and access to the overall Ethereum ecosystem. Centralized layer 2 networks can set their own price structures and have nearly all the same controls as a stand-alone private blockchain such as deciding who has access to the network and what kind of data will be visible to others.\n\nThis comes with a cost. Layer 2 networks must purchase transaction processing space on the Ethereum mainnet to finalize their transactions (known as blob space) — but those costs are likely to be lower than those associated with starting a network from scratch and competing head-on with Ethereum. In fact, according to Token Terminal, the costs of developing a layer 2 are remarkably low. For Base, a layer 2 network run by Coinbase, during June of 2025, the network generated $4.9 million in fee revenue and spent just $50,000 on layer 1 settlement fees.\n\nIndeed, the layer 1 settlement fees on Ethereum are so low they have set off a fiery debate within the network ecosystem about whether they are too low, and that layer 2 networks represent a transfer of benefits from layer 1 stakeholders to layer 2 networks. It is likely this will result in some re-balancing of fees, but even a 10x increase in fees is not likely to alter the fundamentally good value proposition that comes with scaling with layer 2 networks.\n\nFurthermore, the recent announcement by Robinhood that they will be building their own layer 2 network on Ethereum fundamentally validates the overall layer 2 thesis within Ethereum: layer 2 networks are not only a good scaling option, they also enable a variety of business models that will entice a wide range of companies to join the network.The layer 2 ecosystem is likely to have a range of participants from the fully decentralized to the completely centralized.\n\nAnd this brings us to the key question: does your company need its own layer 2 network? Chances are, you don’t. The real value proposition of a blockchain ecosystem is the ability to work in cooperation with others without any one party controlling the network. If you’re a manufacturing company, for example, you want to work with your suppliers and customers on a level playing field with your competitors. Blockchains let everyone join in without favoring any one participant. In the long run, working together on a level playing field is much cheaper and preferable to trying to integrate into different systems controlled by each one of your key customers or suppliers.\n\nWhile some layer 2 networks look very profitable right now, this is only true if you can generate good transaction volume. Many of the layer 2 networks operating are doing little to no business as they struggle to differentiate themselves in a crowded market. According to L2Beat, most of these networks have less than $1mm in TVL bridged in from Ethereum and are averaging less than one user operation per second.\n\nSo when does a company need its own layer 2 network? My hypothesis is that this works best for firms that can aggregate significant transaction volume into the network and whose customers do not have the means or the individual volume to make their own direct connection to Ethereum. Right now, that largely means financial services firms that have thousands or millions of retail customers, from Coinbase to Kraken to Robinhood. More firms will surely follow. Having a layer 2 network might be seen, in the future, the way we looked at having a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. Brokerage firms would want them, but a car maker wouldn’t find value in it.\n\nThree questions would be useful in determining if a firm should launch its own Ethereum layer 2 network: first, is the company able to aggregate a significant volume of its own transactions or clients compared to other networks? Second, is transacting on-chain central to the company’s core business model (e.g., are you an intermediary, especially a financial one that presently transacts on traditional financial rails). Lastly, does your layer 2 approach offer a differentiated value proposition compared to the many other network options out there? If you can say yes to all three options, this is a possible path forward.\n\nFor most other types of firms, they may find the optimal value proposition to be connecting directly to Ethereum, or one of the other open layer 2 networks. It will be less costly and more private than going through an aggregator who will be able to mark up your transaction costs and see your transaction flow and less costly than running your own network.\n\nI suspect, however, that before we are done, quite a few firms that have no need to run their own layer 2 will launch one anyway for the same reasons many firms launched private chains in the past.\n\nNo matter how reliably they have failed, the attraction of private blockchains was always hard to counter. The allure of “controlling your destiny” and “taxing the ecosystem” was hard to resist. Public chains, with their openness, interoperability, and permissionless nature can look scary to business users who would prefer more control.\n\nTo the same buyers who wanted private chains, centralized layer 2 networks look like a halfway house that may seem appealing. Unlike private chains, I don’t think they are all doomed to fail, but I do suspect only a few will succeed. History keeps repeating itself - mostly because we’re not very good at paying attention to it. Here we go again.\n\nDisclaimer: These are the personal views of the author and do not represent the views of EY.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Pantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform",
    "content": "TransCrypts, a blockchain startup building tools for people to own and share verified credentials, has raised a $15 million seed round led by Pantera Capital.\n\nThe round included Lightspeed Faction, Alpha Edison, Motley Fool Ventures, and a mix of returning investors such as Mark Cuban and Protocol Labs.\n\nThe funding follows a strong summer for the San Francisco-based company. In September, TransCrypts won CoinDesk’s Pitchfest at Consensus Hong Kong, taking home $10,000 in tokens, a trophy, and ten coaching sessions.\n\nFounder and CEO Zain Zaidi said that the win helped the team refine its vision for what he calls “self-sovereign identity”— a way for people to control their data directly, without relying on employers, universities, or government agencies.\n\nZaidi founded the company after a bureaucratic mishap nearly cost him his spot in grad school when his transcripts were misplaced. “If we can’t prove who we are or what we’ve done, we lose something essential,” he said in an earlier interview with CoinDesk.\n\nTransCrypts began by digitizing employment verification. Its platform lets users collect, encrypt, and share records directly with employers, background checkers, or others who need them. The system stores encrypted data off-chain, while the hashes live on-chain, so users can prove authenticity without revealing personal details.\n\nNow, with HIPAA certification secured, TransCrypts plans to extend the model to health and education credentials. That could allow patients to carry verified medical histories between providers, or graduates to share diplomas and transcripts with potential employers—all without the need for intermediaries.\n\nThe move comes as fraud risks are on the rise. Americans lost $43 billion to identity theft in 2023, and deepfake scams have surged more than 1,800 percent in a year, according to the company’s release. Zaidi argues that decentralized identity could help counter these trends by allowing people to control what data is shared, when, and with whom.\n\nTransCrypts claims to already serve 4 million users and over 450 enterprise clients, including firms in healthcare and staffing. The new capital will fund expansion into these regulated sectors and strengthen tools for verifying credentials in real time.\n\nFor users, that might mean faster hiring or simplified onboarding for hospitals and schools. For the broader market, it signals growing confidence in blockchain-based identity systems—once a niche idea, now seen as a possible safeguard against the deepfake era.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nBitcoin Rebounds Above $123K as Miners Rally; VanEck Sees $644K BTC Amid Gold Gains\n\nThe gold rally may need to cool before bitcoin could really gain momentum, suggested another analyst.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies tied to fiat money like the U.S. dollar, are increasingly popular as a payments alternative and is projected to potentially grow into a trillion-dollar market in the next years from the current $270 billion. The expansion was bolstered by the recently enacted GENIUS Act, the law setting federal rules for stablecoin issuers.\n\nTether’s USDT stablecoin has grown into a $169 billion asset with hundreds of millions of users worldwide. It is particularly popular in emerging markets, where high banking fees and inflation push people toward digital dollars.

    "content": "Stellar’s XLM navigated a volatile 24-hour trading session from Sept. 11 to Sept. 12, oscillating between $0.384 and $0.400 before closing near $0.393. The token saw early strength, advancing to session highs around $0.400, but selling pressure in the final hours pushed prices back toward support levels at $0.392. Market analysts note this late-session distribution activity underscores the corrective movement that has weighed on XLM despite its otherwise resilient performance.\n\nThe pullback coincided with rising competition in the payments sector. New entrant Remittix has launched with a 15% USDT referral incentive and secured $25.2 million in funding, sharpening challenges to incumbents like Ripple’s XRP and Stellar’s XLM. The aggressive go-to-market strategy highlights intensifying rivalry in the cross-border payments arena, a sector long dominated by these two tokens.\n\nAt the same time, some technical strategists see long-term upside for XLM. Elliott Wave projections suggest the token could stage a 400% rally toward $1.96, a move that would place Stellar’s market capitalization in the $60–$71 billion range. That outlook hinges on broader adoption trends and the resilience of Stellar’s ecosystem as competition ramps up.\n\nAdding to market intrigue, a digital asset researcher has suggested Ripple and Stellar may be collaborating on a unified global financial infrastructure that leverages Zero-Knowledge cryptographic protocols.

FLock’s “FLock OFF” subnet develops lightweight language models that run directly on devices using federated learning, keeping data private while scaling through community contribution.\n\nCustody providers including BitGo, Copper and Crypto.com have also joined via Yuma’s validator, demonstrating a degree of institutional interest and laying the groundwork for Bittensor’s long-term growth, the report said.\n\nMetrics reinforce the expansion. In the second quarter, the network recorded 50% subnet growth, 16% miner growth and a 28% increase in non-zero wallets. Staked TAO rose 21.5% while the token’s market cap approached $4 billion by July. Subnet tokens collectively neared $800 million.\n\nYuma founder and CEO Barry Silbert said Bittensor is “changing the way AI is built and distributed,” adding that Yuma is preparing to introduce Yuma Asset Management to help investors gain exposure to the ecosystem.\n\nWith decentralized intelligence moving from niche experiment to functioning infrastructure, Yuma argues adoption is no longer theoretical.\n\n“It’s already underway,” Silbert said.\n\nCORRECTION (Sept. 15 18:00 UTC): Corrects that Yuma is not an AI-powered e-commerce platform, but an AI-powered Bittensor subnet accelerator and validator.\n\nMore For You\n\nShayne Coplan Becomes Youngest Self-Made Billionaire After Polymarket's $2B Investment: BBG\n\nShayne Coplan’s net worth reportedly passed $1 billion after the New York Stock Exchange's owner valued Polymarket at $8 billion.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It had sold 15.2 million shares, raising $425 million.\n\nGemini posted a net loss of $283 million in the first half of the year. That follows a $159 million loss for all of 2024, according to the company’s latest financials.\n\nDespite the deepening red ink, Gemini priced its IPO nicely above the initially hoped-for level and secured a $50 million strategic investment from Nasdaq earlier this week. The stock exchange operator said the deal is intended to expand access to Gemini’s crypto custody services for institutional clients. It also positions Gemini as a distribution partner for Nasdaq’s trade management software, Calypso.\n\nGemini's IPO follows that of other crypto-native platforms, including stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), Bullish (BLSH), eToro (ETOR) and Figure Technologies (FIGR), that also went public this year in what appears to be a booming capital market for crypto firms amidst a wave friendly U.S. regulatory action.

    "title": "Massachusetts State Attorney General Alleges Kalshi Violating Sports Gambling Laws",
    "content": "Prediction market Kalshi is violating Massachusetts' state gambling laws, its attorney general alleged in a lawsuit Friday.\n\nAttorney General Andrea Joy Campbell alleged in a filing that sports event contracts, which Kalshi introduced in January 2025, violate the state's sports wagering laws, which require operators to be licensed. Campbell is asking for a court to block Kalshi from offering sports prediction markets in the state without a license, as well as seeking monetary and other relief.\n\nPrediction markets have grown in popularity over the past few years, with crypto-focused companies like Polymarket and firms like Kalshi seeing immense interest over questions such as who would win the last presidential election. While the Massachusetts filing notes that Kalshi does offer these different categories of prediction markets, its lone charge is focused on the company's sports-related bets.\n\nThe filing said Kalshi's prediction markets, which are structured as binary options, operate the same way licensed sports wagering operators' products do, comparing it to FanDuel as an example.\n\n\"Kalshi is in the business of accepting wagers, defined as 'a sum of money or thing of value risked on an uncertain occurrence' on amateur and professional sporting events in the form of selling sporting event contracts,\" the filing said, adding, \"Kalshi’s sporting event contracts constitute sports wagering\" as defined by Massachusetts laws and applicable regulations.\n\nKalshi had been through a lengthy legal tussle at the federal level when it battled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the legality of its business model, but the regulator ultimately backed down earlier this year. Now, one of Kalshi's board members, former CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz, is President Donald Trump's nominee to run the agency.\n\nA portion of the Massachusetts lawsuit points to Kalshi actions the attorney general's office alleges are designed to hook possible bettors.\n\n\"Kalshi’s platform employs behavioral design mechanisms drawn from gambling psychology, including features that encourage impulsive engagement, exploit award anticipation and diminish users’ perception of financial risk,\" the filing said.\n\nIt pointed to Kalshi's website design, including presenting possible payouts in \"bright green font, a color that signals safety and correctness,\" while odds were presented in black font. \"This interface design subtly encourages high-risk transactions by emphasizing reward while obscuring risk.\"\n\nCampbell said \"if Klashi wants to be in the sports gaming business in Massachusetts, they must obtain a license\" in a statement. \"Sports wagering comes with significant risk of addiction and financial loss and must be strictly regulated to mitigate public health consequences.\"\n\nIn a statement, a Kalshi spokesperson said, \"Kalshi offers its users a fair, transparent, federally-regulated and nationwide marketplace. Rather than engage in dialogue with Kalshi as many other states have done, Massachusetts is trying to block Kalshi’s innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas. Prediction markets are a critical innovation of the 21st century, and all Americans should be able to access them. We are proud to be the company that has pioneered this technology and stand ready to defend it once again in a court of law.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Solana’s SOL rallied above $239 on Friday, extending its sharp September gains, as Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz described the blockchain as “tailor-made” for global financial markets and analyst Ali Martinez charted a potential path to $1,314.\n\nMartinez, a well-known crypto analyst, highlighted Solana’s breakout from what chart technicians call a cup-and-handle pattern, a formation that often signals the start of a long-term rally.\n\nIn his chart, Martinez marked $1,314.41 as the main technical target, using Fibonacci retracement levels to project Solana’s upside. The pattern reflects a multi-year basing structure: Solana’s deep decline in 2022 and 2023 formed the “cup,” while the sideways consolidation of 2024 and early 2025 formed the “handle.”\n\nAccording to Martinez, the breakout above resistance near $220 validates the structure and opens the way to much higher levels if momentum persists.\n\nNovogratz, speaking on CNBC’s \"Squawk Box\" Thursday, laid out a sweeping bull case for Solana and crypto more broadly. He began by pointing to treasury companies tied to both ETH and SOL, which he said are raising billions of dollars and bringing “lots of energy and money” into the digital asset ecosystem.\n\nHe then pivoted to bitcoin, predicting the world’s largest cryptocurrency should see a surge toward the end of the year.\n\nBut his most detailed remarks focused on Solana and the changing regulatory landscape. Novogratz said U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has made clear that he wants all markets to move on-chain, citing a speech earlier in the week where Atkins declared, “On-chain capital markets and agentic finance are on the horizon, and the world is watching.”\n\nAs part of that backdrop, Novogratz flagged Nasdaq’s proposal to the SEC to allow tokenized securities to be traded directly on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Combined with the new U.S. stablecoin framework, he argued, crypto finally has both the technology and the regulatory clarity to serve as financial market infrastructure.\n\nOn the technology side, Novogratz emphasized Solana’s raw capacity, saying the blockchain can handle 14 billion transactions per day — enough, in his words, “to process all the transactions in equities, fixed income, commodities and foreign exchange combined.” He went on to call Solana a blockchain that is \"tailor-made\" for financial markets.\n\nAdding it up — scalable infrastructure, a pro-blockchain regulatory stance and billions in new institutional inflows — Novogratz concluded that “this is the season of SOL,” a moment when Solana is positioned to take a leading role as capital markets shift on-chain.\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights (Sept. 11 15:00 – Sept. 12 14:00 UTC)\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "Hedera’s native token HBAR posted modest gains during the September 11–12 trading window, climbing from $0.237 to as high as $0.245 before closing at $0.240. The move reflected a surge in institutional participation, with market activity closely tied to fresh developments around potential exchange-traded products.\n\nCorporate momentum built after Grayscale Investments revealed plans for a potential HBAR trust and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) added a Canary HBAR ETF filing to its regulatory database. The listing, under the proposed ticker HBR, accompanied similar submissions for Solana and XRP, underscoring growing Wall Street appetite for digital assets beyond Bitcoin.\n\nTraders reacted sharply to the news. Technical resistance at $0.245 triggered profit-taking, while $0.240 emerged as a key institutional support level, reinforced by late-session volume spikes that topped 17 million tokens. Analysts say the speculation could set up a test of the $0.25 psychological threshold if momentum continues.\n\nStill, industry observers caution that DTCC inclusions represent only preliminary steps, not SEC approval. Regulators remain focused on addressing market manipulation risks and investor protection standards for non-Bitcoin crypto assets, leaving the timeline for any HBAR-based ETF uncertain. For now, the filings have placed Hedera firmly on Wall Street’s radar, driving institutional attention even amid regulatory fog.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "Father of Crypto Bills, French Hill, Says Market Structure Effort Should Tweak GENIUS",
    "content": "U.S. Representative French Hill is among his House of Representatives colleagues watching from the sidelines as their Digital Asset Market Clarity Act is overhauled by senators, but he and Senator Cynthia Lummis seem to be in agreement that one of the bill's aims should be to re-cast what Congress already did on stablecoins.\n\nSo far, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the marquee accomplishment for the crypto industry and its lawmaker allies in Washington. As the new law of the land, federal regulators are already beginning work to implement its oversight of U.S. stablecoin issuers.\n\nBut that was a bill authored in the Senate after years of work in the House on similar texts, so when the House passed its Clarity Act this year on crypto market structure, it tied to that bill some changes to GENIUS. The tweaks outlined in Section 512 at the very tail end of that legislation include:\n\n\"We just thought these were ways to make GENIUS stronger and better, based on work we've done in the House,\" Hill said in an appearance this week at CoinDesk's Policy and Regulation event in Washington.\n\nOn the sidelines of that same event, Senator Cynthia Lummis, the staunch crypto advocate who heads the Senate Banking Committee's digital assets subcommittee, said that she anticipates the Senate's eventual market structure bill will modify the young stablecoin law. She said she wants to \"be very respectful of the House's amendments.\"\n\n\"So I do think that there will be some language that changes GENIUS,\" she said.\n\nLater, at a Cato Institute event on Thursday, Hill got into the topic again, saying, \"I prefer the House version, but we were able to work between the two houses to outline a few changes that we would make to GENIUS, and we put them in the Clarity Act.\"\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee's Republicans recently released a draft version of their bill and some senators, including Lummis, still talk about finishing their bill by the end of this month. Though its House counterpart cleared that chamber with a massive bipartisan vote — 308-122 — at least one of the Republicans on that committee, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, has expressed reservations about the readiness of the Senate's work.\n\nWhile Hill noted that the Senate committee hasn't been working on these topics as long as the House, \"I think they can get this done,\" he said. Work teams from both parties in the Senate are toiling away, he said, \"and they are collaborating to get to yes.\"\n\nThe timeline now in mind for crypto advisers in the administration, including Tyler Williams at the Treasury Department, is turning the market structure effort into law by the end of this year — the target currently offered by Lummis.\n\nRead More: Senators Still Hopeful for Crypto Market Structure Law by End of Year\n\nMore For You\n\nState of Crypto: What Happens to Crypto if Government Shutdown Lingers\n\nA short-term shutdown probably won't hurt crypto's efforts in D.C. much.

    "title": "Senators Still Hopeful for Crypto Market Structure Law by End of Year",
    "content": "The U.S. Senate's market structure bill should pass by the end of the year, leading lawmakers working on the effort said Wednesday, though efforts on this bill will likely push beyond the Sept. 30 deadline previously set by the Senate Banking Committee's head.\n\n\"I don't want to put an artificial deadline on anything,\" said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), speaking at CoinDesk's Policy and Regulation event in Washington, D.C. \"We're in the middle of negotiations about whether we're going to have a bipartisan budget, so the most important issue that Congress has to deal with right now is the fiscal cliff.\"\n\nThe question of timing has loomed large in the market structure work, with President Donald Trump having initially set an August deadline to have all the congressional crypto work on his desk. That optimistic deadline slipped first to the end of September, when Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott had said he wanted to have the market structure work done.\n\nThat deadline now still holds for part of the job, said Senator Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Republican who heads the panel's crypto subcommittee. She said she hopes to have the Banking Committee's work on it finished by then, but that will still leave the other necessary committee — Senate Agriculture — catching up in October, she added. While Lummis has previously mentioned Thanksgiving as a target, she said on Wednesday that \"might be too optimistic.\"\n\n\"It's really important to me that we get this done by the end of the calendar year,\" Lummis said. \"It's like being pregnant for four years, you know. Please, let it happen.\"\n\nA group of Senate Democrats published a list of priorities they wanted to see included in any market structure bill, ranging from consumer protections to regulators' jurisdictions.\n\n\"What it allows for is an understanding that this is going to be bipartisan,\" Gillibrand said, adding that Democrats may have different perspectives on issues like on- and off-ramps for decentralized finance and consumer protections.\n\nOne of the Democrats' pillars would, if implemented, bar lawmakers including the president and vice president's families from profiting off of crypto projects. Gillibrand said it was important to have an ethics component to prevent any appearance of self-dealing or breaches of the Emoluments Clause.\n\n\"I think it's important to have this lens of ethics,\" Gillibrand said. \"It's something that really undermines the entire industry.\"\n\nHowever, she added that at this point in the negotiations process, there was no \"line in the sand\" for Democrats. \"It's very important to me and I'd like to get the best ethics provision that's possible.\"\n\nLummis, speaking after the panel, said she would rather see any effort to restrict crypto trading by elected officials be its own separate effort, and potentially combined with securities and other investments, because she argued that cryptocurrencies shouldn't warrant distinct treatment.\n\n\"I think that we're going to have to have a dialogue with Democrats who are concerned about this president and future presidents' participation,\" she said.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Historical data suggests that bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,330.40\nhas likely put in its September 2025 low, around $107,000 on the first of the month.\n\nLooking back to July 2024, a consistent pattern emerges where bitcoin tends to form a bottom for the month within the first 10 days of each month.\n\nThe notable exceptions were February, June and August 2025, when the lows came later in the month, but even then, the market experienced a correction within those first 10 days before resuming its broader trend.\n\nSpeculatively, the reason bitcoin often puts in its low within the first 10 days of the month could be tied to institutional portfolio rebalancing or the timing of key macroeconomic events that tend to cluster early in the month.\n\n\"It’s worth noting that several futures and options markets expire on the final day of the month or the first day of the next, this can lead to short term volatility and a subsequent lull in trading activity as traders either rollover trades or reposition entirely,” said Oliver Knight, deputy managing editor, data and tokens, at CoinDesk.\n\nOf course, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, but as Q4 approaches it is worth noting that this quarter has historically been bitcoin’s strongest, delivering an average return of 85%.

    "title": "Here Are the 3 Things That Could Spoil Bitcoin's Rally Towards $120K",
    "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,363.85\ncontinues to gain ground, consistent with the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout from early this week, which opened the door for a rally to $120,000.\n\nPrices have crossed above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), a widely-tracked momentum indicator. Additionally, the guppy multiple moving average (GMMA) indicator is teasing a renewed bull cross. Taken together, these two developments may draw momentum chasers to the market, accelerating the price rise.\n\nThat said, there are at least three reasons to continue being cautious. Let's take a look at those individually.\n\nBTC is closing on the bull fatigue zone above $115,000.\n\nWhile past patterns do not guarantee future results, it is notable that since July, bitcoin’s bull momentum has consistently weakened above the $115,000 level, as reflected by the long upper wicks on the last two monthly candles.\n\nThese long wicks indicate that although bulls pushed prices to new record highs above $124,000, strong selling pressure forced the price back below $115,000, signaling a key resistance level and potential hesitation among buyers.\n\nWith the U.S. labor market weakening at a rapid pace, futures traders have priced in 70 basis points (bps) of rate cuts by Dec. 31. That's almost three 25-basis-point rate cuts, starting from Sept. 17. Further, traders have priced in a total of 125 bps of easing by July 2026, which would take the benchmark interest rate down to 3% to 3.25% range from the present 4.25-4.50 range.\n\nMarket participants appear confident that the central bank will look past the sticky inflation, as highlighted by Thursday's consumer price index, and cut rates to support the labour market and economic growth. These dovish expectations starkly contrast with those of the Fed's peers, such as the European Central Bank (ECB), which appear to have moved on from rate cuts. In other words, the rate differential favors USD weakness.\n\nYet, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, continues to hover in the recent range of 97.00 to 98.00. The index has dropped just 0.20% to 97.55 this week despite the sharp rise in the Fed rate cut pricing.\n\nThis raises the question: Has the dollar already priced in the Fed rate cuts? If so, it could recover from here, capping gains in the dollar-denominated assets like BTC and gold.\n\nThe chart shows that the dollar sell-off has run out of steam since the index hit a low of 96.37 on July 1.\n\nAs of writing, the Bollinger bands, or volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the index's 20-day SMA, were at their tightest since March 2024. The so-called squeeze means a big move in either direction could happen soon. A bullish one may not bode well for BTC.\n\nExpectations of rapid Fed rate cuts have fueled anticipation of a sharp decline in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which influences borrowing costs for consumers, businesses, and governments alike. Hence, a slide in the 10-year yield would likely lead to greater risk-taking across both the economy and financial markets.\n\nHowever, longer-term monthly charts indicate a generational bullish shift in momentum for yields, suggesting that the downside could be limited. So, the anticipated flood of money into riskier assets driven by expectations of ultra-low rates may not materialize. In other words, ultra-low interest rates are unlikely to return anytime soon, which should keep fixed-income instruments attractive to investors.\n\nThe 10-year yield has surged in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, ending a four-decade-long downtrend that began in 1981.\n\nFurthermore, the 50, 100-, and 200-month MAs have realigned bullishly one above the other. Such a bullish configuration last occurred in the 1950s, marking the onset of a three-decade rally in the benchmark yield.\n\nThe same thing can be said for the two-year yield, which tends to be more sensitive to interest rate expectations.\n\nRead more: Crypto Pundits Retain Bullish Bitcoin Outlook as Fed Rate Cut Hopes Clash With Stagflation Fears\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The US government posted a $345 billion deficit in August, with receipts of $344 billion overshadowed by $689 billion in spending. The largest outlays were Medicare at $141 billion and Social Security at $134 billion, but what stands out is net interest at $93 billion, now the third-largest expense. This highlights the growing pressure that rising borrowing costs are placing on federal finances.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, but history suggests it wont be that straight forward. In September 2024, the Fed eased policy by 100bps only to see yields on the long end move sharply higher. The 30 year Treasury jumped from 3.9% to 5%, and today sits at 4.7%.\n\nWith recent data pointing to an acceleration in inflation, the risk is that cutting rates could fuel further price pressures. That would force yields higher, increase debt servicing costs and potentially deepen the fiscal hole, creating a challenging backdrop for policymakers and markets alike.\n\nMarkets are responding decisively. Gold has surged to new record highs, just below $3,670 per ounce, marking a year-to-date gain of almost 40%. Bitcoin is also gaining traction, climbing above $115,000 as investors search for alternatives in an environment where debt sustainability is becoming a bigger concern.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Crypto Pundits Retain Bullish Bitcoin Outlook as Fed Rate Cut Hopes Clash With Stagflation Fears",
    "content": "Key economic data released Thursday indicate that the U.S. economy may be on the brink of stagflation, a challenging mix of sluggish growth, a weakening labor market, and rising prices.\n\nDespite these concerns, crypto market participants remain optimistic, focusing instead on anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts and signals from traditional markets as drivers for higher crypto valuations.\n\n\"The underlying driver of this market cycle is a monetary tailwind, and that remains intact, despite the risk of stagflation. Bitcoin, and crypto more broadly, are absorbing capital as a hedge against fiat dilution and long-term fiscal instability. They aren’t functioning solely as a bet on risk, like we’ve seen in past cycles,\" Shane Molidor, founder of Forgd, a crypto advisory platform, told CoinDesk.\n\nData released Thursday showed that consumer prices rose 0.4% month-on-month in August, driving the annualized inflation rate to 2.9% — the highest since January. That was up from 2.7% in July. Meanwhile, first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged last week to their highest level in four years. Early this week, the BLS announced a record downward revision to jobs created during the year ended March 2025.\n\nDespite the supposed stagflationary data, the S&P 500 surged to new all-time highs, while the dollar index fell by 0.5% to 97.50, as traders focused on anticipated Fed rate cuts and looked beyond inflation worries.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,283.99\n, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, briefly topped $116,000, building on its recent bullish technical breakout. As of the time of writing, BTC was trading at $115,244. Altcoins such as Solans's SOL\nSOL\n$228.52\n, LINK\nLINK\n$22.54\n,\nDOGE\n$0.2580\nposted bigger gains on a 24-hour basis.\n\nTraders widely expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points to 4% on Sept. 17, with additional reductions anticipated through the end of the year. This outlook remains largely unchanged despite Thursday’s disappointing economic data, signaling continued confidence that the Fed will prioritize supporting the labor market, looking past concerns of sticky inflation.\n\nLe Shi, managing director of crypto market maker Auros, made an interesting observation that the Magnificent 7 coins – large-cap technology stocks known for their market dominance and strong growth potential – appear relatively insulated from stagflation fears. The continued strength in the so-called Mag 7 coins, which have planned billions in capital expenditures and research and development (R&D) expenditures on AI, could grease the crypto bull sentiment.\n\n\"On stagflation being a looming threat to the current bull run, the Mag 7 and the S&P 493 have significantly decoupled of late. As a result, the AI narrative – arguably the largest theme in this bull run so far – appears more insulated from stagflation fears because of this,\" Shi added.\n\nSam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management's Directional Fund, stated that the risk-reward ratio in the cryptocurrency market remains attractive.\n\n\"Traders appear to be getting an ‘all clear’ for a rate cut next week after CPI and labor data delivered no shocks or negative surprises. With these releases behind us — and after yesterday’s softer-than-expected PPI print — we believe risk/reward continues to favor the upside,\"\n\nGaer explained that in a potential stagflationary scenario, the Fed may be forced to prioritize price stability over employment and raise rates, which could lead to a temporary risk aversion or sell-off in growth and liquidity-sensitive assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. However, this would only strengthen the long-term crypto bull case.\n\n\"Over the medium to long term, however, this dynamic would strengthen the structural bull case for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly, as investors seek scarce, non-sovereign assets to hedge persistent fiat debasement,\" Gaer said, adding that the probability of a prolonged stagflationary regime is low.\n\nMarkus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said the disinflation trend is likely to resume in the coming months.\n\n\"Our inflation model and leading indicators point to falling inflation, a backdrop that gives risk assets room to run. A 25bp cut with guidance for more would calm markets, not spook them, and set the stage for a bullish finish to the year,\" Thielen told CoinDesk.\n\nAs bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies reach new all-time highs, a select group of altcoins is poised to experience significant rallies. Notably, there is a growing consensus about solana's\nSOL\n$228.67\nprice prospects.\n\n\"We have seen strong demand for SOL during the past 2 weeks. SOLBTC is trading at its highest level in seven months and pushing up against the psychological 0.002 level, with strong upward momentum continuing from early August. Rotation into SOL is naturally occurring as several SOL DATs are coming online, with over $1B raised (or being raised) into various SOL vehicles,\" Gaer explained.\n\nThe other favorites among industry participants are the DeFi protocol Ethena's ENA token and its synthetic dollar, USDe, as well as decentralised exchange Hyperliquid's HYPE token.\n\n\"Younger investors aren’t interested in slow 7% annualized returns. Instead they’re turning to perpetuals markets and trading with leverage, making riskier bets with greater upside potential. Hyperliquid is built for exactly that type of user: it’s permissionless, always-on, and increasingly positioned as the go-to for high-beta plays, especially among younger investors who view volatility as a feature, not a bug,\" Molidor said explaining the bullish case for Hyperliquid's HYPE token.\n\nHe pointed out the yield advantage Ethena has as the Fed cuts rates, driving down the return on traditional fixed-income instruments and dollar equivalents, such as stablecoins.\n\nThink of it like the popular yield-differential strategy in foreign exchange markets, where a country’s currency tends to strengthen when its bond yields rise relative to others, attracting capital flows due to higher returns.\n\n\"As the Fed cuts rates and short-term T-Bill yields fall, traditional stablecoins like Circle’s become less profitable and Ethena’s tokenized basis trade becomes more lucrative. It’s a rare circumstance where Ethena’s stablecoin yields go up as Fed rates come down, which could make the token particularly attractive in the next phase of the market cycle,\" he noted.\n\nAuros pointed to CRO along with SOL, BNB and HYPE as key tokens to watch out for during the next upswing in the crypto market.\n\nRead more: Rising Jobless Claims Eclipse Inflation Data as Recession Fears Resurface\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

On-chain demand from digital asset treasuries (DATs) is also expected to provide a floor for prices.\n\nOne lingering concern for investors is seasonality, the report said, noting six straight September declines for BTC against the dollar between 2017 and 2022.\n\nBut this pattern failed to play out in both 2023 and 2024, the analysts noted. Not only that, but the small sample size and wide dispersion of outcomes limit the usefulness of seasonal indicators.\n\nA more meaningful factor, Coinbase said, is where we are in the DAT cycle. Publicly disclosed DATs hold over 1 million BTC ($110 billion), 4.9 million ETH ($21.3 billion) and 8.9 million SOL ($1.8 billion) as of Sept. 10.\n\nLate entrants are now chasing altcoins further down the risk curve, which Coinbase believes puts markets in a “player-versus-player” phase, a dynamic that favors large-cap tokens but may soon lead to consolidation among smaller DAT players.\n\nHeading into the final quarter, the exchange's analysts maintained a constructive outlook, expecting strong liquidity, a favorable macroeconomic backdrop and regulatory momentum to keep crypto markets well supported.\n\nRead more: Crypto Institutional Adoption Appears to Be in the Early Phases: JPMorgan\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "This Invisible 'ModStealer' Is Targeting Your Browser-Based Crypto Wallets",
    "content": "A new strain of malware purpose-built to steal crypto wallet data is slipping past every major antivirus engine, according to Apple device security firm Mosyle.\n\nDubbed ModStealer, the infostealer has been live for nearly a month without detection by virus scanners. Mosyle researchers say the malware is being distributed through malicious recruiter ads targeting developers and uses a heavily obfuscated NodeJS script to bypass signature-based defenses.\n\nThat means the malware’s code has been scrambled and layered with tricks that make it unreadable to signature-based antivirus tools. Since these defenses rely on spotting recognizable code “patterns,” the obfuscation hides them, allowing the script to execute without detection.\n\nIn practice, this lets attackers slip malicious instructions into a system while bypassing traditional security scans that would usually catch simpler, unaltered code.\n\nUnlike most Mac-focused malware, ModStealer is cross-platform, hitting Windows and Linux environments as well. Its primary mission is that of data exfiltration, and the code is presumed to include pre-loaded instructions to target 56 browser wallet extensions designed to extract private keys, credentials, and certificates.\n\nThe malware also supports clipboard hijacking, screen capture, and remote code execution, giving attackers the ability to seize near-total control of infected devices. On macOS, persistence is achieved via Apple’s launching tool, embedding itself as a LaunchAgent.\n\nMosyle states that the build aligns with the profile of “Malware-as-a-Service,” where developers sell ready-made tools to affiliates with limited technical expertise. The model has driven a surge in infostealers this year, with Jamf reporting a 28% rise in 2025 alone.\n\nThe discovery comes on the heels of recent npm-focused attacks where malicious packages like colortoolsv2 and mimelib2 used Ethereum smart contracts to conceal second-stage malware. In both cases, attackers leveraged obfuscation and trusted developer infrastructure to bypass detection.\n\nModStealer extends this pattern beyond package repositories, showing how cybercriminals are escalating their techniques across ecosystems to compromise developer environments and directly target crypto wallets.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "In the AI Economy, Universal Basic Income Can’t Wait",
    "content": "The rise of artificial intelligence and robotics is forcing us to face something we’ve all sensed coming: millions of jobs are going to soon vanish. From factory floors to law offices, from truck driving to financial analysis, AI is learning to do our work faster, cheaper, and often better. This isn’t a future problem — it’s happening now. The real question is what we’re going to do about it, because the old idea of tying survival to a paycheck is going to break.\n\nA lot of public personalities are offering big ideas. My own favorite solution is Universal Basic Income (UBI), which I have promoted for over a decade. It’s where everyone gets a guaranteed monthly cash payment from the government, no strings attached, enough to cover the basics. UC Berkeley Professor of Finance Emeritus, Mark Garman has suggested Universal Basic Capital, giving everyone income-producing assets and dividends via a superfund. XPrize founder Peter Diamandis on X recently promoted Universal Basic Ownership, where we all own a stake in the companies driving the AI revolution. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talks about Universal Extreme Wealth, where AI’s productivity is so massive that everyone lives in abundance and luxury.\n\nThese all have merit, and I like them all. But putting actual cash in people’s pockets through UBI is still the most practical, immediate way to keep society stable as AI takes over more of the economy.\n\nUBI is simple. Everyone gets a monthly check — no hoops or bureaucracy. If desired, I’d also support payments in crypto and using the blockchain. Regardless, if machines are doing most of the work and generating the wealth, we should cut people in directly to the money earned. And this way, no one falls through the cracks because they didn’t fill out the right form or meet some arbitrary requirement, as often happens in the welfare system. Ultimately, it’s not just about survival —it’s about freedom. With basic financial security, people could spend more time creating, learning, caring for loved ones, or simply living without the constant grind.\n\nCritics of UBI raise cost, inflation, or the fear that people will stop working. But real-world trials — from Alaska’s oil dividend to pilot programs around the world — tell a different story. People don’t suddenly become lazy. Most keep working, start businesses, or invest in skills. What changes is that they’re less stressed, healthier, and more willing to take productive risks.\n\nMark Garman’s Universal Basic Capital has appeal. Giving people a stake in a superfund derived from assets in automation-dependent businesses could build long-term wealth and make everyone a participant in market gains. It’s a way to fix the imbalance between those living off capital gains and those living off wages. But markets crash. Dividends dry up. And setting up accounts, teaching financial literacy, and managing assets adds complexity that UBI avoids.\n\nPeter Diamandis’s promotion of Universal Basic Ownership is attractive too: let’s all directly own part of the AI-driven companies and automated industries of the future. That aligns the public’s interests with technological progress and could turn the whole country into shareholders. But convincing existing companies to give away significant equity is a steep climb. And even if they did, ownership stakes don’t reliably pay the rent without selling them.\n\nSam Altman’s Universal Extreme Wealth is the boldest vision — a future so abundant that everyone lives like today’s multi-millionaires. AI drives the cost of goods and services close to zero, and money becomes less important because everything is nearly free. It’s inspiring, but far off. We can’t bet the next 10 or 20 years on a perfect utopia showing up exactly when we need it —though I support the long term idea.\n\nAll these ideas share the same moral core: if AI is going to create unimaginable wealth, it can’t just pile up in a few corporate bank accounts. It has to be spread broadly or society will fracture when the jobless pick up pitchforks and revolt. But UBI is the one that can work now, to keep people worry free.\n\nFirst, it’s about liquidity. People who lose their jobs to automation don’t need a stock portfolio —they need money for groceries and rent this month. Second, it’s simple. You can send cash to people today without building new systems from scratch. Third, it respects individual choice. People can decide for themselves whether to pay off debt, take a class, help their family, or start a side hustle.\n\nThe beauty of UBI is that it doesn’t block us from trying other models later. We can start with cash security, then layer in investment capital, shared ownership, crypto projects, or new distribution systems. It’s the safety net that makes everything else possible.\n\nI’m not against a future of universal ownership or extreme wealth. I’d love to see it. But while we wait for that future — and hope it works out the way we think — UBI can make sure no one is left behind. It can keep the economy stable and buy time to build whatever comes next.\n\nThis isn’t about “free money” in the pejorative sense. It’s about recognizing that in a world where machines can produce nearly everything, our sense of human worth has to be separated from having a job. Direct cash is the fastest, cleanest, and fairest way to make sure AI’s benefits reach everyone, not just the handful of people who own the machines.\n\nIf we get this right — if we make the AI revolution work for all of us —then maybe the abundance Sam Altman talks about won’t just be a dream. It could be the natural next step.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "BlackRock Weighs Tokenized ETFs on Blockchain in Push Beyond Treasuries: Report",
    "content": "BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval.\n\nThe discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion.\n\nTokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain.\n\nProponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails.\n\nThe products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Christie’s has shuttered its digital art department, ending a short-lived but influential experiment that saw Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have a place alongside paintings, sculptures, and other works in the auction house’s art sales, according to a report from Now Media.\n\nTwo staffers were let go at the end of August, including vice president of digital art Nicole Sales Giles, while specialist Sebastian Sanchez will remain in New York.\n\nGiles played a prominent role in Christie's Art+Tech Summit in Hong Kong last year, which ran alongside Hong Kong Fintech Week.\n\nGiles had been a prominent face of Christie’s digital push, notably at the Art+Tech Summit in Hong Kong last year, which ran alongside Hong Kong Fintech Week.\n\nThere she argued that Christie’s brought the same valuation discipline to NFTs as it did to paintings or sculptures, but with one critical difference.\n\n\"What’s unique with digital art is the community engagement aspect, which absolutely comes into play in a way it never has with traditional art,” she said at the time.\n\nOthers at the summit acknowledged that the category was still far from mature.\n\n“I do not think at this very moment we have a very standardized understanding of [digital art’s] value,” said Angelle Siyang-Le, director of Art Basel Hong Kong last year. “That’s why you do see a lot of it all of a sudden coming out, and then obviously created that excitement.

By contrast, Ethereum itself has rallied 76% in the past three months to $4,509, outpacing the NFT market.\n\nOn X, some observers argued that Christie’s decision reflects simple economics rather than capitulation, noting that NFTs are increasingly being absorbed into mainstream contemporary sales rather than treated as a separate “collectible” category.\n\nThis retreat by Christie’s hints that without firmer valuations and clearer standards, NFTs risk remaining an add-on to contemporary art rather than sustaining a market of their own.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bitcoin's continued volatility compression has intensified with what analyst Checkmate refers to as the “choppiness index,” a metric that gauges sideways price consolidation.\nPrevious CoinDesk research has highlighted that bitcoin’s implied volatility remains at multi-year lows, which supports the sideways consolidation in bitcoin's price.\n\nThis choppiness reflects bitcoin’s recent rangebound behavior. For the past few months, bitcoin has traded between $110,000 and its all-time high of $124,000, currently hovering around $113,000.\n\nOn the one-month timeframe, according to checkonchain, the choppiness index has risen to 54. The last time it exceeded this level was in early November 2024, just before President Trump’s election victory triggered a surge in bitcoin to over $90,000. At that point, the index peaked at 64. The previous instance before that was in early 2023, at the onset of the current bull cycle, when the index stood at 57.\n\nThis pattern suggests there may still be room for further consolidation, especially as volatility continues to compress.\n\nThe next major macroeconomic catalyst is the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), scheduled for release at 12:30 PM UTC. This could act as a trigger for a volatility breakout or directional price move.\n\nCoinDesk research from February also noted a prolonged period of which similarly preceded the price decline that eventually bottomed out in April around $76,000.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$111,480.33\nis up around 1.4% in the past 24 hours as investors await key inflation data in the U.S., which could shape expectations for a much-discussed interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nBefore that hits though, the European Central Bank announces its own interest-rate decision. It's expected to keep rates steady, a surprise move may ruffle a few feathers.\n\nEconomists are forecasting a modest rise in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) due at 8:30 a.m. That, coupled with the near 1 million jobs revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this week, points to growing chances of rate cuts.\n\nOn Polymarket, bettors now see a 79% chance of a 25 basis-point rate cut this month, while perceived odds of a 50 bps drop have surged to 18% from 5.4% in a week. The CME’s FedWatch tool shows traders positioned for a 92% chance of a 25 bps cut, and an 8% chance of an even deeper one.\n\nA rate cut would benefit risk assets, and the growing odds of such an event are being felt on the market. Spot bitcoin and ether ETFs attracted a combined $928 million in net inflows yesterday and bitcoin hit $114,000 for the first time since early August.\n\nStill, some analysts are flashing caution. Jake Ostrovskis, the head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, pointed out that persistent inflation and slowing growth are raising stagflation concerns.\n\nSince late August, Ostrovskis said, investors have been moving away from ether after its outperformance and back into bitcoin. Options activity reflects that shift, with traders protectively buying puts on ETH and risk reversals for March and June 2026 dipping into negative territory.\n\nThis “creates a setup where the market feels well hedged” should pressures ease, Ostrovskis noted. “At the end of the day, we're close to the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle.”\n\nMeanwhile, gold remains near record highs, with the bitcoin-to-gold ratio approaching resistance levels that previously signaled crypto bottoms, analysts at QCP Capital said.\n\n“If history rhymes, bitcoin could be in the process of establishing another bottom, setting the stage for the next major leg higher,“ they wrote.\n\nStill, geopolitical turmoil shouldn’t be ignored. Russia violated Poland’s airspace this week, forcing NATO to scramble its jets and prompting Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to say this was “the closest we have been to open conflict since World War II.”\n\nTusk underlined there’s “no reason to believe we’re on the brink of war,” and Moscow denied responsibility for the attack.

    "content": "Kinetiq, a liquid staking protocol built around Hyperliquid’s HYPE token, has seen an explosion of inflows in recent weeks as users pile in to farm the protocol's airdrop points campaign.\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) on Kinetiq has jumped from roughly $458 million in mid-July to over $2.1 billion today, according to DefiLlama.\n\nWhile part of the increase can be attributed to a 20% rise in the price of HYPE over the same period, another big driver has been raw deposits. The amount of HYPE staked has climbed from under 10 million tokens in July to nearly 40 million now. Kinetiq’s points program opened mid-July, underscoring that it is driving activity in its ecosystem.\n\nThe surge demonstrates the growing influence of Hyperliquid, which is fast becoming a DeFi heavyweight as liquidity, trading activity and staking demand migrate onto its ecosystem.\n\nPoints programs in particular, where protocols distribute future token allocations to early participants, continue to pull in yield-hungry crypto investors. By staking HYPE through Kinetiq, users not only earn standard staking rewards but also accumulate points toward a potential Kinetiq token airdrop.\n\nFor many DeFi traders, that double yield opportunity has proven irresistible, some have shared on X.\n\nRead more: Native Markets Leads Early Voting for Hyperliquid’s USDH Stablecoin Contract\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "XLM Jumps 4.3% Amid Volatile Trading Session",
    "content": "XLM posted sharp swings in the latest 24-hour trading cycle, oscillating within a $0.017 band that marked a 4.3% fluctuation between $0.379 and $0.396. The token’s rally took shape around midnight on September 11, when prices climbed from $0.384 to a high of $0.396 by mid-morning.\n\nThe upward push came alongside a surge in market activity, underscored by a 112 million unit spike in volume at noon — far above typical averages. Still, the momentum faltered, and XLM slipped back to $0.387, confirming firm resistance in the $0.394 to $0.396 zone.\n\nThe broader trading context highlighted the interplay between macro and micro forces. Market-wide institutional participation and broader crypto sentiment amplified volume, while technical ceilings limited sustained advances.\n\nTraders saw buyers consistently absorbed at the $0.394-$0.396 range, while accumulation near $0.379-$0.381 underscored an emerging support base.\n\nOn a shorter horizon, XLM’s performance between 1:14 and 2:13 p.m. on September 11 captured the consolidation dynamic. The asset held to a tight $0.003 range, fluctuating between support at $0.386 and resistance at $0.389.\n\nDuring this window, two short-lived bursts of bullish activity briefly pushed the price to $0.389 on strong volume, only to face immediate rejection. The repeated failures at this level reinforced the significance of $0.389 as a ceiling in line with the 24-hour trend.\n\nTaken together, the pattern reflects a market still testing its boundaries. While high-volume surges showcase interest and participation, repeated rejection at resistance levels signals distribution pressure limiting upside potential. For traders, the technical story hinges on whether XLM can convert $0.389 into support, or whether continued selling will force another retest of the $0.379-$0.381 base.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "U.S. inflation for August came in hotter than expected, though likely not enough to derail the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates next week.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4% last month versus expectations for 0.3% and 0.2% in July. On a year-over-year basis, CPI was higher by 2.9% versus a forecast 2.9% and 2.7% in July.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, climbed 0.3% in August against forecasts for 0.3% and July's 0.3%. Year-over-year core CPI rose 3.1% compared with the 3.1% forecast and July’s 3.1%.\n\nBitcoin slipped about 0.5% from $114,300 to $113,700 in the immediate aftermath of the data.\n\nU.S. stock index futures gave up modest ground, now higher by just 0.1% across the board. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped about five basis points to 4.00% and the dollar strengthened a bit. Gold rose on the news, trimming an earlier loss of about 0.4% to 0.15% at $3,675 per ounce.\n\nPerhaps tempering any downside move in the markets and surely responsible for that big dip in the 10-year Treasury yield, was the weekly Initial Jobless Claims report, released at the same time as the CPI. In that, jobless claims rose to a far worse than expected 263,000 from 236,000 the previous week. Forecasts were for just 235,000.\n\nThe two reports point to the difficult situation the U.S. central bank finds itself in, with the employment picture worsening, but the inflation rate refusing to turn lower.\n\nPrior to the CPI data, markets were pricing in a 92% chance of a 25 basis point cut at the upcoming Fed meeting and an 8% chance of a 50 basis point cut, according to CME FedWatch. The inflation number likely puts to rest any idea of a 50 basis point move, which had gained steam following last Friday's soft jobs report and Wednesday's weak PPI numbers.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Learn more.\n\n– Sarah Morton\n\nCrypto has officially entered the ETF mainstream, and the numbers tell the story.\n\nETPs Hold the Bitcoin Crown\n\nIn case you missed it, crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) have become the biggest holders of bitcoin, now sitting on 1.47 million coins — about 7% of the total 21 million supply, according to data compiled by Hold15Capital on X.\n\nPublic companies come next with just over 1 million, followed by governments holding around 526,000, according to bitcointreasuries.net\n\nLooking closer, BlackRock's iShares IBIT exchange-traded fund (ETF) leads the pack with 749,000 coins, while Fidelity’s FBTC holds 201,000 and Grayscale’s GBTC sits at 185,000. That share of supply is likely to keep climbing as more investors, especially institutions, jump in under a friendlier U.S. crypto administration.\n\nCrypto Moves Into the ETF Mainstream\n\nCryptocurrency has become a key topic in the Trackinsight Global ETF Survey.\n\nThis year’s edition gathered insights from more than 600 professional investors overseeing over $1 trillion in ETF assets. They shared their views across active, thematic, ESG, fixed income and crypto segments.\n\nWhen asked about their appetite for crypto ETFs in 2025, more than half said they plan to increase allocations in client portfolios.\n\nCrypto ETFs Break Into the Big Leagues\n\nCryptocurrency ETFs in the U.S. ranked 8th in net inflows over the past year, according to ETF Central’s ETF segments dashboard — another sign of how powerful this asset class has become since gaining access through the ETF wrapper. The results of the Trackinsight survey reflect that shift, showing how professional investors who were once hesitant are now increasingly open to crypto.\n\nSolana and XRP ETFs Edge Closer to the Spotlight\n\nWith bitcoin and ether ETFs already established, solana and XRP are lining up for their own spot debut. Optimism is high, but the SEC has yet to approve any filings. Still, with the legal cloud around Ripple lifted and a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in Washington, the odds of launch are looking better than ever.\n\nIn the meantime, investors have been riding the momentum through U.S. futures-based solana and XRP ETFs. North of the border, Canada has already pulled ahead with spot launches, while Europe continues to lead the charge with ETPs covering nearly every major cryptocurrency — including solana and XRP.\n\nSince 2024, XRP and solana ETPs have attracted $2.02 billion and $1.35 billion in net inflows globally, with momentum picking up after the first related U.S. spot ETF filings.\n\nThe Big Race: Gold vs. Crypto\n\nThe visual highlights a key trend in modern finance: the battle for a place in investor portfolios.\n\nGold, the perennial store of value, maintains its lead with ETPs nearing $400 billion in assets, as it remains a critical hedge against inflation and geopolitical turmoil.\n\nYet, the explosive growth of crypto ETPs, which have raced past $200 billion, signals a new era.\n\nThis isn't a zero-sum game; instead, the chart suggests that in an uncertain world, investors are turning to both assets to provide different forms of protection and growth.\n\n- Rony Abboud, role, chief marketing officer, Trackinsight and ETF Central\n\nQ: What happened with global crypto ETF/ETP flows in August?\n\nEther-linked products attracted $4.27 billion, the strongest monthly intake this year and ~88% of August’s net inflows, driven primarily by US-listed funds.\n\nBitcoin products saw $169.1 million in net outflows at the category level, despite issuer-level dispersion. Solana and XRP products recorded inflows of $383.4 million and $279.7 million, respectively, signalling selective diversification beyond BTC and ETH.\n\nFlows by geography:\n\nQ: How has the U.S. positioned itself since the debut of listed crypto ETFs and ETPs?\n\nSince bitcoin ETFs became available in January 2024, U.S.-listed products have become the core venue for regulated digital-asset exposure, with USD-denominated vehicles ~94% of global activity.\n\nFor investors, this scale and consistency of participation underscores the United States’ role as the primary market for price discovery and capital formation in crypto.\n\nQ: What policy developments have continued to firm the US operating backdrop for crypto ETFs?\n\nTogether, these steps reinforce structural clarity as the market matures.\n\n- Joshua de Vos, research lead, CoinDesk\n\nMore For You\n\nStablecoins: The Revolution in Global Money Transfers\n\nStablecoins are no longer just a bridge between crypto and fiat — they are becoming the rails of global commerce, writes Nonco CEO Fernando Martinez.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.

    "title": "Rising Jobless Claims Eclipse Inflation Data as Recession Fears Resurface",
    "content": "Markets are ignoring a hotter-than-expected inflation report and instead turning their attention to the latest signs that the U.S. labor market is faltering — a shift in focus that points to growing concern about a deeper economic slowdown.\n\nConsumer prices rose a bit more than expected August, according to CPI data released Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Both the headline rate of 2.9% and the core rate of 3.1% remain solidly higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Normally, that would suggest the U.S. central bank should hold off on interest rate cuts.\n\nBut investors barely flinched at the data and instead focused what typically is the lesser-followed weekly initial jobless claims from the Department of Labor. That data showed claims soaring to 263,000 last week — the highest in nearly four years and up from 236,000 the previous week and 235,000 forecast. That focus was reflected in bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield sliding five basis points to below 4% for the first time since the April tariff panic tanked global equity markets.\n\nCrypto markets initially dipped on the faster than expected inflation data, but quickly rebounded as the employment data took center stage. Bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,399.68\nand ether\nETH\n$4,534.33\nare only modestly higher, but the bigger action is in altcoins, suggesting the sort of animal spirits one might associated with monetary policy about to get a lot easier. Solana\nSOL\n$229.36\nhas risen 11% week-over-week to its highest level since January and\nDOGE\n$0.2586\n17% on a weekly basis.\nXRP\n$2.9028\nis ahead 6.6% over the last week and back above $3.\n\n“Evidence of a slowdown in the U.S. is now appearing in the hard data; it’s no longer just in the sentiment surveys,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch.\n\nAs for the real economy, today’s numbers offer a troubling glimpse into something the U.S. central bank has been working hard to avoid: stagflation. This economic condition, defined by the simultaneous occurrence of high inflation and stagnant growth, is rare and difficult to fix. For policymakers, it’s a catch-22.\n\nCutting interest rates to stimulate growth risks inflaming inflation. But failure to ease monetary policy while the employment situation deteriorates isn't a much better alternative.\n\nFor now, traders are betting that the Fed will lean toward protecting growth over stamping out inflation, with odds pointing to a rate cut next week as a near certainty. Today’s data, however, suggests that the balance is becoming harder to manage and the path ahead may be more complicated than the market is pricing in.\n\n“It's going to be a rough few months ahead as the tariffs impacts work their way through the economy,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Americans will experience higher prices and (likely) more layoffs.”\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Crypto-related stocks including Galaxy Digital (GLXY), Circle Internet (CRCL) and Bitfarms (BITF) posted double-digit gains on Thursday as bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,388.03\nrose the highest since mid-August.\n\nGalaxy, a digital asset investment and data center conglomerate led by Mike Novogratz, added 12%. The company was a lead investor in Forward Industries' $1.65 billion fundraising closed today to build a Solana\nSOL\n$229.26\ntreasury vehicle.\n\nIt might also be benefiting from rising appetite for data center plays, as big tech firms make billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) hosting contracts such as Microsoft's deal with Nebius on Tuesday.\n\nThe same logic applies to bitcoin miner Bitfarms (BITF), which has set out to expand in high-performance computing and appointed Wayne Duso, a former executive of cloud service giant Amazon Web Services, to the board last month. The stock advanced another 18% today, extending gains to more than 60% this week.\n\nFor USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, Thursday's 16% rally could be a technical rebound absent any clear news catalyst, breaking the downtrend that started in June and saw the stock decline roughly 60% from its post-IPO peak.\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), digital trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) and bitcoin miners MARA Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) also advanced.\n\nThe companies outpaced the broader equity markets, with the S&P 500 index recently up 0.82% and the Nasdaq 100 index 0.69% higher.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin treasury vehicles Metaplanet (3355) and Nakamoto (NAKA) declined 10% and 14%, respectively. Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate owner of BTC, was little changed.\n\nThe declines occurred even as bitcoin advanced toward $115,000, rebounding from an initial dip on rising CPI inflation and higher jobless claims reports in the early U.S. morning hours.\n\nRead more: Strategy's S&P 500 Snub Is a Cautionary Signal for Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries: JPMorgan\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "The Avalanche Foundation aims to raise $1 billion to create two crypto treasury companies holding millions of AVAX tokens, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\nThe AVAX tokens would be bought from the foundation, the non-profit group that oversees the Avalanche blockchain, at a discounted price, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe foundation was in talks to raise up to $500 million through a private investment led by Hivemind Capital in an unidentified Nasdaq-listed company, with the aim of completing the deal by the end of the month, the FT said. Former White House press secretary Anthony Scaramucci was advising on the deal.\n\nA second deal would create an AVAX treasury company via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\n\nThere has been a plethora of publicly-listed companies pivoting to a crypto treasury strategy this year, seeking to emulate the approach of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) which now holds nearly 640,000 BTC ($73 billion).\n\nHowever, the cooling of the crypto bull market in August saw a lot of these companies' shares take a hit, which may have dimmed enthusiasm for the model.\n\nAVAX advanced nearly 8% in the last 24 hours, but has fallen around 2.1% since midnight UTC, while the broader crypto market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index is 0.65% higher.\n\nThe Avalanche Foundation did not respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.\n\nMore For You\n\nShayne Coplan Becomes Youngest Self-Made Billionaire After Polymarket's $2B Investment: BBG\n\nShayne Coplan’s net worth reportedly passed $1 billion after the New York Stock Exchange's owner valued Polymarket at $8 billion.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "HBAR Rises 5% Despite Volatile CPI Session",
    "content": "Hedera’s HBAR token saw a volatile 23-hour stretch between Sept. 10 and 11, swinging in a narrow 5% band between $0.23 and $0.24. The token dipped to its $0.23 support level early in the session before rebounding on heavier-than-usual trading volumes. Daily volume averaged 35.4 million, but activity surged to 156.1 million by midday Sept. 11 as institutional money appeared to flow in, propelling HBAR back toward the $0.24 ceiling.\n\nDespite the rally, HBAR struggled to break through resistance at $0.24, where strong selling pressure emerged. The rejection at this technical level underscored the significance of $0.23 as firm support and $0.24 as a critical barrier for further gains. Analysts note that a close above $0.24 could open the door to a 25% rally toward the $0.25 target, but failure to breach resistance leaves the token range-bound in the $0.21–$0.23 corridor.\n\nThe surge in trading activity coincided with regulatory developments. On Sept. 9, Grayscale filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Hedera HBAR Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), alongside similar filings for Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. The SEC has set a Nov. 12 deadline to decide on the proposed Nasdaq listing, making the next two months pivotal for HBAR’s institutional adoption prospects.\n\nThe ETF filing has stoked demand from traditional asset managers seeking broader exposure to digital assets. With regulatory clarity on the horizon, HBAR’s price action reflects a tug-of-war between bullish institutional interest and technical barriers. Market participants will be watching closely whether the SEC’s decision provides the breakout catalyst HBAR needs to test higher levels.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "title": "Bull Trap Warning for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP Emerges as S&P 500 Prints Rising Wedge; U.S. Inflation Eyed",
    "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies are looking bullish, with market leader bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,327.55\nexhibiting a classic inverse head-and-shoulders breakout that could propel it toward $120,000.\n\nBut there's a catch. The daily chart for the S&P 500 E-Mini futures is displaying a bearish pattern, indicating a potential sell-off that could weigh on the cryptocurrency market and trap bulls on the wrong side of the market.\n\nThe E-mini futures have risen nearly 5% to a record high of $6,542 since Aug. 1. The slow ascent has taken the shape of a rising wedge pattern identified by converging trendlines connecting July 31 and Aug. 15 highs and lows reached on Aug. 1 and Aug. 22.\n\nThe converging trendlines indicate that bullish momentum is waning, increasing the likelihood of a sell-off.\n\nWhen asked to identify and analyze the pattern on the S&P 500 futures, Google Gemini replied, \"When a rising wedge, which is a bearish reversal pattern, appears after an extended rally to record highs, it significantly increases the probability of a sharp downside move. It suggests that buyers are exhausted and that the rally is running on fumes. The pattern indicates that the market is setting up for a major trend reversal rather than a simple pullback.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies are known to closely track Wall Street sentiment, which means that a potential decline in the S&P 500 could weigh on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe odds of a breakdown in the S&P 500 could rise sharply if Thursday’s U.S. consumer price index (CPI) prints hotter than expected. Such a result, combined with the recent labor market weakness, may rekindle fears of stagflation—the worst-case scenario for risk assets—putting additional pressure on equities and cryptocurrencies alike.\n\nThe median forecast for the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) in August 2025 is a 2.9% year-over-year increase (not seasonally adjusted), according to FactSet. If this estimate holds true, it will be the highest annual rise since January 2025, when the CPI reached 3.0% and well above the Fed's 2% target. Additionally, this 2.9% figure would surpass the trailing twelve-month average inflation rate of 2.6%.\n\nMore importantly, the median estimate (year-over-year, not seasonally adjusted) for the core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is 3.1%.\n\nThe 25-delta risk reversals tied to Deribit-lited bitcoin and ether options were negative out to December expiry, according to data source Amberdata. In other words, short and near-dated BTC and ETH puts traded at a premium to calls, reflecting a bias for downside protection.\n\nA put option protects the buyer from a decline in the value of the underlying asset. A call provides an asymmetric bullish exposure. The 25-delta risk reversal involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa.\n\nAccording to Options Insights' Founder, Imran Lakha, the put bias in BTC is likely due to institutions placing long-term hedges. Flows have continued to trend lower on the over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm.\n\n\"Flows again featured the [ETH] 26 Sep 4k put, lifted up to 73v,\" Paradigm noted.\n\nWhile BTC's inverse head-and-shoulders breakout suggests a strong bullish direction, XRP's price action appears indecisive.\n\nThe payments-focused cryptocurrency remains locked in a descending triangle and continues to trade within the Ichimoku cloud. Together, these indicators suggest a period of consolidation and uncertainty.\n\nA breakout from the triangle might invite stronger buying pressure, potentially leading to a re-test of $3.38, the swing high from Aug. 8. That said, the descending triangle, by itself, is generally considered a bearish pattern. That's because the downward-sloping trendline connecting lower highs indicates that sellers are progressively getting stronger and could soon penetrate the horizontal support level.\n\nSpeaking of DOGE, it has retaken the bullish trendline from June lows, trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market. Additionally, prices have crossed into bullish territory above the Ichimoku cloud, which suggests scope for a test of the July high of 28.76 cents.\n\nHowever, traders still need to watch out for a potential rising wedge breakdown in S&P 500 futures, as a reversal there could cap gains in DOGE and weigh on its price momentum.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nThe first signs of how validators are leaning in Hyperliquid’s hotly contested stablecoin vote are in, and the Stripe-aligned Native Markets team has an early lead.\n\nAs of Thursday morning Hong Kong time, Native Markets has secured 30.8% of the delegated stake, led by heavyweight validators infinitefield.xyz (13.5%) and Alphaticks (5.2%).\n\nPaxos Labs, the New York–regulated issuer behind PayPal’s PYUSD, sits at 7.6% with backing from B-Harvest and HyBridge. Ethena has picked up 4.5%, while Agora, Frax, and Sky, despite splashy proposals, have yet to attract meaningful support, though many of the most prominent validators have yet to cast their virtual vote.\n\nThe bigger picture: more than half of stake, 57%, remains unassigned.\n\nThat block includes some of the most influential validators on Hyperliquid, such as Nansen x HypurrCollective (the single largest validator with over 18%) and Galaxy Digital. Where they ultimately land will decide whether Native Markets’ early momentum carries through to the September 14 deadline.\n\nNative Markets is pitching a Hyperliquid-native stablecoin issued via Stripe’s Bridge infrastructure, promising yield-sharing to the Assistance Fund and HYPE buybacks.\n\nBut prominent voices, including Agora CEO Nick van Eck, warn that Stripe’s simultaneous push to launch its Tempo blockchain and its control of wallet provider Privy could create conflicts.\n\nDespite those criticisms, some validators appear to view Stripe’s global payment rails as a compelling advantage.\n\nWhat’s at stake is far more than just another token launch. Hyperliquid currently holds $5.5 billion in USDC deposits, around 7.5% of the stablecoin’s supply.\n\nReplacing that with USDH would redirect hundreds of millions in annual Treasury yield. Paxos has pledged 95% of reserve earnings to HYPE buybacks, Frax promised 100% of yield directly to users, Agora offered 100% of net yield alongside institutional custodianship, and Sky (ex-MakerDAO) proposed 4.85% returns plus a $25 million “Hyperliquid Star” project to bootstrap DeFi on the chain.\n\nHyperliquid already commands nearly 80% of decentralized perpetuals trading. Whichever issuer wins the USDH contract won’t just be minting a stablecoin, they’ll be wiring themselves into the financial backbone of one of crypto’s fastest-growing exchanges.\n\nBTC: Currently trading at $114,053, up 2.6% in the past 24 hours and 2.1% over the past week, though still down 3.9% for the month. The move reflects a short-term rebound fueled by positive risk sentiment and steady demand, even as longer-term consolidation continues.\n\nETH: ETH is trading at $4,373.99, up 2%, as investors shrug off a mass-slashing event that penalized over 30 validators.\n\nGold: Gold held near $3,635 an ounce after Tuesday’s $3,674 peak as investors await U.S. inflation data that could shape Fed cuts, while ANZ raised its year-end gold target to $3,800 and sees a peak near $4,000 by June on strong investment demand and central-bank buying.\n\nNikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.23% and the Topix down 0.18%, after Wall Street hit record highs on Fed rate-cut hopes and upbeat inflation data.\n\nS&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.3% to a record 6,532.04 Wednesday after an unexpected drop in wholesale prices bolstered hopes for a Fed rate cut next week.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Kiln, a provider of staking services for institutions, said it started an “orderly exit\" of all its Ethereum\nETH\n$4,527.81\nvalidators, framing the move as a safeguard for clients following SwissBorg’s SOL earn wallet being exploited for $41.5 million.\n\nThe decision underscores how staking providers are increasingly prioritizing resilience and client protection over uninterrupted uptime.\n\nIn a Tuesday blog post, Kiln described the exits as a precautionary step and said the decision was made in consultation with stakeholders and security firms. The company added it has temporarily paused access to some services while \"hardening its infrastructure.\"\n\nThe company emphasized that there was no indication of additional losses and that stakers’ ETH remains protected. Kiln noted that its non-custodial framework ensures client assets remain under their control throughout the process, further reducing the risk of exposure during the exit period.\n\n“We took immediate action once we identified a potential compromise in our infrastructure,” CEO Laszlo Szabo said in the post. “Exiting validators is the responsible step to protect stakers, and we are monitoring the process closely to ensure the security and reliability of our services.”\n\nKiln says validators are being exited in an “orderly” process governed by Ethereum’s protocol rules. The firm estimates the exit will take 10–42 days per validator, after which withdrawals may take up to nine days.\n\nValidators continue earning rewards while they wait in the exit queue, but not after they have fully exited and are awaiting withdrawal. Kiln stressed these delays are enforced at the protocol level and cannot be accelerated by the provider, meaning clients should expect a measured process rather than immediate liquidity.\n\nRead more: SwissBorg’s SOL Earn Wallet Exploited for $41.5M After Partner's API Is Compromised\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

CF Benchmarks said in a report earlier this week that suggested bitcoin is trading below its fair value range when mapped against U.S. M2 growth.\n\nThe firm noted that the gap between M2 expansion and the BTC price is as wide as at any time since August 2024, which has turned into a strong entry point. Similar divergences in 2016, 2019, and 2021 preceded notable upside.\n\nOver the past decade, BTC has shown a positive correlation with M2, with monetary growth typically leading price by roughly three months. If that historical relationship holds, liquidity tailwinds later in Q4 could favor a push higher.\n\nTactically, bulls still have levels to reclaim.\n\n“Bitcoin continues to attract buyers on intraday dips, forming a smooth and rather fragile uptrend, with the main battle now around $112K,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk.\n\n“The real test sits near $115K, just above the 50-day moving average. Staying above it would signal a return to optimism, but for now BTC is lagging stocks at record highs,”Kuptsikevich added.\n\nOptions desks report firmer demand for protection ahead of this week’s U.S. inflation data, consistent with neutral-to-bearish positioning in the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, SOL’s bid has tracked a steady rise in TVL to a record $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, while memecoins captured fresh flows. Analysts floating $300 SOL targets tie the call to persistent activity and on-chain liquidity, though follow-through likely depends on broader risk appetite.\n\nThe macro calendar can still spoil the party, however, as U.S CPI figures are due later on Thursday.

    "title": "Trump's CFTC Hopeful Quintenz Takes His Dispute With Tyler Winklevoss (Very) Public",
    "content": "Brian Quintez, U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, published a text exchange he had with Tyler Winklevoss in his first public statement since his confirmation process appeared to stall over the summer at the White House's direction, saying he believed that Trump \"might have been misled.\"\n\nQuintenz shared a series of text messages he said he'd exchanged with Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Gemini — which is set to go public this week — and Winklevoss Capital. Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler's twin brother and co-founder, may have also been in the group chat, which was titled \"tw-cw-bq\" but did not send any messages in the screenshots shared by Quintenz. In the chat, dated July 24, Tyler Winklevoss asked Quintenz if he'd seen a post on X from June 17 where Tyler announced Gemini had filed a complaint with the CFTC's inspector general about Division of Enforcement attorneys who had pursued charges against Gemini.\n\n\"I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,\" Quintenz said in his posts, representing a highly unusual move for a nominee in the midst of a federal confirmation process. \"It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.\"\n\nBefore the Senate left Washington for its August break, Quintenz's nomination was set for what was thought to be an easy procedural step in the Senate Agriculture Committee to advance it to the floor for his final confirmation vote. But the White House halted that vote for reasons it didn't make clear at the time, though Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss had been waging a rhetorical campaign to stop his confirmation.\n\nWinklevoss told CoinDesk in an interview in July that he'd been making the case that Quintenz was a bad choice because of the former commissioner's wish to increase the CFTC budget to oversee the crypto industry, his past views on the legal liability for crypto developers and what Winklevoss characterized as Quintenz's improper attempts to influence the CFTC on behalf of prediction market firm Kalshi.\n\nRead more: Gemini's Tyler Winklevoss Says Trump CFTC Pick Quintenz Has 'Disqualifying' Views\n\nQuintenz's post on Wednesday suggested that, in his view, Winklevoss was upset that Quintenz did not join in criticism of CFTC's enforcement efforts after the agency pursued charges against Gemini that were settled in January.\n\n\"I know we had spoken about this in the winter where I recalled my original extreme disappointment at [the Enforcement Division] for pursuing this so aggressively,\" a text from Quintenz said. \"I commit to you to having a fair and reasonable review of the matter and the division and individuals involved to determine if they acted inappropriately.\"\n\nHe went on to say that a \"fully confirmed chair\" should be the person to handle the matter, but that if someone currently employed by the CFTC was \"communicating with\" the Winklevosses, he would have to \"give that careful thought.\"\n\nWinklevoss asked if Quintenz was saying that Gemini should have waited to file their complaint until after the Senate confirmed the former commissioner, to which Quintenz replied that \"any decision or response to your complaint should be made by and given the full weight of the confirmed chair.\"\n\nThe crypto executive said they had spoken about the CFTC's enforcement effort against Gemini after Quintenz asked for the Winklevoss brothers' endorsement in December.\n\n\"Cultural reform, which includes rectifying what happened to us, should be the highest priority,\" Winklevoss said. \"I'd like to understand your thoughts on this and how you plan to align with President Trump and the administration's mandate to end the lawfare and make amends for it.\"\n\nHe added that he would \"be happy to raise the issue with the president himself\" if Quintenz thought he was being undermined by current CFTC employees.\n\nWinklevoss and a spokesperson for Gemini did not immediately return requests for comment. CoinDesk could not independently verify the texts' authenticity. Quintenz declined to comment further when reached by CoinDesk.\n\nIn July, a coalition that represented the vast majority of the crypto industry came out to press President Donald Trump to move forward to get Quintenz confirmed, calling him the \"right person at the right time\" to run the CFTC. Though the Senate has been back from break for a while and has returned to its confirmation work for many of Trump's appointees, the committee hasn't yet scheduled a follow-up vote for Quintenz\n\nMeanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has been pressing forward on an industry-friendly \"Project Crypto\" initiative while the temporary chief at the CFTC, Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has been standing in at the sister agency with a similar \"crypto sprint.\" The two of them have made recent joint moves to clear the regulatory path for digital assets.\n\nUPDATE (Sept. 11, 2025, 14:04 UTC): Adds Quintenz's reply to CoinDesk.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Ethereum Rare Mass Slashing Event Linked to Operator Issues",
    "content": "Ethereum experienced a rare slashing event on Wednesday, with 39 validators penalized, according to blockchain explorer Beaconcha.in.\n\nThe validators were tied to the SSV Network, a distributed validator technology (DVT) protocol that decentralizes staking infrastructure by splitting validator keys across multiple operators.\n\nDespite the scale of the incident, SSV founder Alon Muroch emphasized that the protocol itself was not compromised. Instead, the penalties stemmed from operator-side infrastructure issues involving third-party staking providers using SSV.\n\nOne cluster of slashed validators was tied to Ankr, a liquid staking provider. According to Muroch, routine maintenance on Ankr’s systems triggered the event. A second slashing involved a validator cluster that had migrated from Allnodes two months earlier. Investigators believe a secondary validator setup caused the duplicate signing that led to penalties.\n\nIn total, 39 validators were slashed, making this one of the largest correlated slashing events since Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. Each validator slashed faces an immediate ETH penalty and could face inactivity leaks, compounded losses. One validator, backed by a 2,020 ETH stake, lost around 0.3 ETH, or about $1,300 at today’s prices, in the process.\n\nWhile slashing is built into Ethereum’s design as a deterrent against malicious or negligent behavior, it remains exceedingly rare. Fewer than 500 validators out of more than 1.2 million active have been slashed since the Beacon Chain went live in 2020. Most incidents, including this one, have been traced to operator issues rather than deliberate attacks.\n\nMass slashings are particularly notable because correlated misbehavior increases the severity of penalties. Ethereum’s protocol enforces additional inactivity leaks when groups of validators are slashed together, amplifying the financial impact.\n\nFor Ethereum’s staking ecosystem, the latest wave underscores a familiar but critical lesson: validator safety hinges as much on infrastructure and operator diligence as on the protocol itself. Even when the underlying software is uncompromised, operational errors can have costly and very public consequences.\n\nRead more: ‘Keep It Simple’: Prevent Your Eth 2.0 From Being Slashed\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "title": "The Protocol: SwissBorg’s SOL Earn Wallet Exploited for $41.5M",
    "content": "This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nWelcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk.\n\nIn this issue:\n\nSWISSBORG’S SOL EARN WALLET EXPLOITED: Crypto exchange SwissBorg said about 192,600 SOL ($41.5 million) was stolen from an external wallet used exclusively for its SOL Earn strategy. The exploit stemmed from a partner's compromised application programming interface (API), a mechanism that allows software systems to communicate with one another, affecting a single counterparty, the exchange said in a post on X. It was not a hack of the SwissBorg platform. The loss affected fewer than 1% of users and represented about 2% of SwissBorg’s total assets, the firm said. All other funds and strategies remain secure, and user balances within the SwissBorg app are unaffected. SOL Earn redemptions are paused while recovery efforts proceed. SwissBorg says it will cover any shortfall, ensuring no user losses. The company is working with white-hat hackers, security firms and law enforcement to recover the funds. A full incident report will follow once investigations conclude. This exploit arrives amid a sharp rise in crypto thefts, with over $2.17 billion already stolen in 2025. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.\n\nLEDGER CTO WARNS OF PNM ATTACK: Charles Guillemet, the chief technology officer at hardware wallet maker Ledger, warned on X that a large-scale supply chain attack was underway after a reputable developer’s Node Package Manager (NPM) account was compromised. According to Guillemet, the malicious code — already pushed into packages with over 1 billion downloads — is designed to silently swap crypto wallet addresses in transactions. That means unsuspecting users could send funds directly to the attacker without realizing it. Guillemet did not name the developer whose account he said was compromised. The incident underscores how deeply interconnected open-source software is and why security lapses in developer tools can ripple into the crypto economy almost instantly. A day later, Guillemet shared that almost zero crypto users had been affected by the hack. “NPM is a tool commonly used in software development using JavaScript, which makes integrating packages easy for developers,” said Guillemet in a message to CoinDesk. When an attacker compromises a developer’s account, they can slip malicious code into widely used packages. “The malicious code attempts to drain users by swapping addresses used in transaction or general on-chain activity and replacing them with the hacker’s address,” Guillemet added. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nBACKPACK EU GOES LIVE FOLLOWING FTX EU ACQUISITION: Backpack Exchange, a global cryptocurrency trading platform, said its European division, Backpack EU, is officially live. Operating out of Cyprus and licensed under the European Union’s MiFID II framework, the exchange is positioning itself as one of the first fully regulated venues in Europe to offer crypto derivatives, starting with perpetual futures. “As far as I'm aware, it's just going to be us and Kraken” in Europe offering perpetual futures, Armani Ferrante, the CEO of Backpack, said in an interview with CoinDesk. The debut follows Backpack’s acquisition of FTX EU earlier this year. In January, the FTX bankruptcy estate said the sale of FTX EU to Backpack was not authorized. Since then, the issue has been resolved and in April the exchange began distributing funds to former FTX EU customers, fulfilling their pledge to compensate users affected by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. Backpack EU will provide users access to over 40 trading pairs with up to 10x leverage, the team said in a statement. The platform says it aims to give both retail and institutional traders a compliant gateway to advanced crypto trading products. The rollout also highlights Backpack’s broader strategy of rebuilding trust in digital assets following a string of exchange failures. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nPOLYGON POS CHAIN EXPERIENCES FINALITY LAG: Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain is live, but transactions are taking longer than usual to lock in, with finality running 10–15 minutes behind schedule. Finality is the assurance that a transaction or piece of data is irreversible once confirmed and added to a block in the blockchain. The foundation said in an X post that a fix has been identified and is being rolled out to validators and service providers. The slowdown was tied to issues on some Bor/Erigon nodes and RPC providers, according to Polygon’s status page. Node restarts resolved the problem for many validators, while others had to rewind to the last finalized block before resyncing, a status page shared. The disruption comes weeks after Polygon’s Heimdall v2 upgrade promised 5-second finality through a modernized consensus stack. – Shaurya Malwa Read more.\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

And so I think, ultimately, our approach has always been to just try to get better every day and do the right thing at every step of the way.”\n\nPart of that strategy is tapping into its proof-of-reserves system. Ferrante says the exchange publishes its validators' attestations daily using zero-knowledge proofs. “It should be the bar. You can do this every day, there's no reason why you can't,” he said.\n\nSince 2024, the company said it has processed more than $160 billion in trading volume globally.\n\nThe team also plans to expand in other regions.\n\n“We're working on the exact same thing here in Japan,” Ferrante said. “That's probably going to be our next place that we turn our eyes to with respect to licensing.”\n\nRead more: New FTX EU Owner Backpack Initiates Customer Claims Process\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

I believe that a truly great financial brand must be built on fairness, transparency, and trust—not on unilateral actions that freeze investor assets. Such measures not only violate the legitimate rights of investors, but also risk damaging broader confidence in World Liberty Financials,\" said.\n\nRepresentatives for Sun and World Liberty Financial did not immediately return CoinDesk's requests for comment.\n\nWLFI tumbled 20% over the past 24 hours. It's down 42% since it started trading on exchanges on Sep. 1.\n\nJustin Sun emerged as a central backer of World Liberty Financial, initially stepping in with a $30 million token purchase and an advisory role in late 2024. Since then, WLFI has had increasing ties to the Tron ecosystem, adding Tron's native token TRX (TRX) to its treasury and with Eric Trump revealing plans to launch the protocol's USD1 stablecoin on Tron.\n\nBy mid-2025, Sun’s total investment in the protocol had grown to about $75 million. On the eve of WLFI token's market debut he was reported to hold nearly $700 million worth of tokens, much of it still vesting-locked.\n\nSun said on Monday, when WLFI launched, that \"we have no plans to sell our unlocked tokens anytime soon.\"\n\nUPDATE (Sept. 5, 05:00 UTC): Adds latest statement from Justin Sun.\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

Teams interested in deploying USDH can submit proposals, and the winning group will be selected by validator quorum, the post added.\n\n\"The USDH ticker is well-suited for a Hyperliquid-first, Hyperliquid-aligned, and compliant USD stablecoin,\" it said.\n\nStablecoins are a crucial piece of infrastructure of crypto markets, serving as liquidity and trading pairs to settle most trades. It's a $270 billion asset class, currently dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. However, with regulation put into place such as the GENIUS Act in the U.S., industry players increasingly create their own token for their ecosystems. Popular crypto wallet MetaMask is launching a stablecoin with infrastructure provider M0, while payment firm Stripe created its own in-house stablecoin with Bridge.\n\nHyperliquid’s trading activity suggests there could be immediate demand. The exchange handled $398 billion in perpetual derivatives trading volume and $20 billion in spot trades last month, DefiLlama data shows. Circle’s\nUSDC\n$0.9997\ncurrently dominates liquidity, making up 95% of the $5.6 billion stablecoin supply on the network.\n\nBy introducing its own stablecoin, Hyperliquid, in theory, could reduce dependency on Circle while capturing revenue from assets backing the token.\n\nRead more: Hyperliquid’s HYPE Token: Why Arthur Hayes Thinks It Has 126x Upside Potential\n\nMore For You\n\nThe Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals\n\nAlso: Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade on Holesky, DoubleZero Goes Live and Bee Maps Raises $42M.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

    "content": "Digital brokerage Robinhood (HOOD) is extending its crypto footprint with a slate of new offerings, including developing its own blockchain network based on\nARB\n$0.4350\nand launching tokenized stocks trading, the company announced on Monday.\n\nThe firm today has debuted its stock token offering, issued on the Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum, for European users, giving access to over 200 U.S. equities and ETFs witt around-the-clock trading during weekdays. With the launch, Robinhood is expanding its crypto-focused EU app with tokenized stocks into an \"all-in-one investment app powered by crypto,\" the company said in a release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nThe firm also confirmed it's building its own layer-2 blockchain network optimized for tokenized assets. The upcoming chain, based on the Arbitrum tech stack, is aimed to support 24/7 trading, self-custody and cross-chain bridging of tokenized assets. A release date has not been disclosed, but persons familiar with the matter said it could go live around later this year, early next year.\n\nThe company announced it's opening access to private equity tokens, starting with tokenized shares in OpenAI and SpaceX.\n\n\"We will continue to work with regulators and bring the entire Robinhood ecosystem on-chain,\" chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev, said during the launch event in Cannes, France.\n\nHOOD shares, traded on Nasdaq, rallied to a fresh record high of $91, advancing over 8% during the Monday session.\n\nRobinhood's push into tokenized assets comes as competition with digital asset exchanges is heating up to offer a unified trading hub for all kinds of financial instruments. Asset tokenization is a read-hot sector that aims to bring real-world assets including equities, funds, real estate onto blockchain rails promising cheaper, faster and more efficient settlements and around-the-clock trading. It's potentially a huge opportunity: the tokenized asset market could grow to $18.9 trillion by 2033, a report by Ripple and BCG projected.\n\nA slew of popular crypto exchanges, including Bybit, Kraken and Gemini have just recently started to offer tokenized stocks to users, while Coinbase reportedly also seeks regulatory approval to do so.\n\nRobinhood's Tenev earlier this year touted asset tokenization as a way to expand investor access that assets that are limited to the wealthy, and advocated for clear U.S. regulations to tokenize securities.\n\nWhile rivals have teamed up with regulated asset tokenization specialists to offer stock tokens, Robinhood is building its own tokenization engine to do so, Seong Lee, head of crypto products, told CoinDesk in an interview.\n\nAs part of the firm's crypt push, Robinhood is rolling out perpetual futures, a popular derivative instrument among crypto traders, for European users. Trades are routed through Bitstamp, one of the world's longest-running active crypto exchange which Robinhood acquired for $200 million.\n\nThe firm has also introduced crypto staking for U.S.-based investors starting with Ethereum's ether\nETH\n$4,527.76\nand Solana's SOL\nSOL\n$201.48\nthat lets token holders earn rewards without leaving the application.\n\nAdditionally, Robinhood will add crypto rewards to its credit card offering later this fall, allowing U.S. customers to invest cashback automatically in digital assets.\n\nRead more: Robinhood Launches Micro Bitcoin, Solana and XRP Futures Contracts\n\nUPDATE (June 30, 15:45 UTC): Adds Robinhood introducing private equity tokens of OpenAI, SpaceX.

    "title": "Nasdaq Seeks Nod From U.S. SEC to Tokenize Stocks",
    "content": "Nasdaq, the U.S. exchange where the tech sector's biggest names list their stocks, is seeking to put stocks on the blockchain, asking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to bless its effort even as others in the securities world are sprinting toward the same tokenization goal.\n\nIf the SEC filing is approved, the exchange would let customers choose either the traditional route for trading equities or to do so on-chain with tokenized stocks — an option that would be treated with the same priority as the legacy method.\n\n\"The Exchange believes the markets can use tokenization while continuing to provide the benefits and protections of the national market system,\" Nasdaq contended in its filing, suggesting that the tokenized assets should be traded \"in regulated markets, namely national securities exchanges, alternative trading systems, and at [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority] regulated broker-dealers.\"\n\nThe move by Nasdaq follows an effort by digital brokerage Robinhood to issue stock tokens for European customers in July, giving access to some 200 U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bringing equities and other real-world assets onto blockchain rails has been among the most sizzling of the digital-asset world's innovations, and the competition has been growing fierce for both traditional finance names and crypto natives to make moves.\n\nSeveral crypto exchanges, such as Bybit, Kraken and Gemini, have been making the leap. But TradFi behemoth Nasdaq — home of the listings for Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and other technology mainstays — is particularly significant.\n\nRead More: Tokenized Stocks Aren’t Working (Yet)\n\nFor its part, Nasdaq would treat this business just like regular stock trading, it said, and have the trading of tokens clear and settle through the Depository Trust Co.\n\n\"The mere fact that an order contains tokenized securities or indicates a preference to clear and settle securities in token form shall not affect the priority in which the Exchange executes that order,\" according to Nasdaq's proposed change with the SEC. The already-digital transactions of stock would — under this new system — be logged via digital ledger, which \"presents novel capabilities by which to record evidence of securities ownership and transactions.\"\n\nThose buying the tokens would gain full rights to the associated shares of stock, including voting and liquidation rights.\n\nNasdaq's new tokenized trading — also offering exchange-traded products, such as ETFs — would begin \"once the requisite infrastructure and post-trade settlement services have been established by\" DTC, which is working on them, the company said.\n\n\"Our proposal aims to provide meaningful benefits to markets by integrating new capabilities into the fabric of our financial system and further advancing the world’s most efficient and trusted markets,\" said Nasdaq President Tal Cohen, in a Monday posting on LinkedIn.\n\nSEC Chairman Paul Atkins has made it clear that tokenization of assets is a major priority for the agency, and the regulator gathered a panel in its series of crypto roundtables earlier this year to explore it. A major component of Atkins' new Project Crypto push at the agency is to clear a path for the world's leading tokenized securities market.\n\n\"This movement of securities from off-chain to on-chain systems is akin to the transition of audio recordings from analog vinyl records to cassette tapes to digital software decades ago,\" Atkins said in May 12 remarks at the agency. \"The migration to on-chain securities has the potential to remodel aspects of the securities market by enabling entirely new methods of issuing, trading, owning, and using securities.\"\n\nRead More: SEC, CFTC Chiefs Say Crypto Turf Wars Over as Agencies Move Ahead on Joint Work\n\nUPDATE (September 8, 2025, 13:49 UTC): Adds comment from Nasdaq.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Who Is Patrick Witt, President Trump's Next Senior Adviser on Crypto?",
    "content": "President Donald Trump's crypto adviser, Bo Hines, exited after only months on the job, and the next in line — his deputy, Patrick Witt — will apparently be shepherding the industry's political priorities in Washington as it still seeks industry-wide regulations and the institution of a federal crypto stockpile.\n\nWitt shares a remarkably similar history with Hines – both ex-football stars who played at Yale before seeking law degrees and falling short in bids for Congress. Witt had a brief stint as a free-agent quarterback for the New Orleans Saints after leading the Yale Bulldogs team that Hines later played on as wide receiver. Both ex-athletes tied their political careers closely to Trump in recent years, and Witt will now be the chief industry liaison for Trump's White House, according to his social-media profile on X that references the title Hines left behind.\n\nAs executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, Witt ascends to the role without a significant crypto background, though Hines also occupied the role without a deep digital assets past.\n\n\"We've had the pleasure of working with Patrick throughout the year and look forward to him continuing to implement policies that will make the United States this global hub of crypto innovation and development,\" said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the Solana Policy Institute, in a statement.\n\nWhen Witt helped introduce Trump at a rally in 2022, he told the crowd that \"government, too often, is the problem.\" But the graduate of Harvard Law School spent some time serving at the federal level and describes himself as a \"public servant\" on his LinkedIn account.\n\nWitt has a few of the common resume staples of D.C. careers: Three years at McKinsey & Co., and past stints at the Office of Personnel Management in the first Trump presidency and some time at the Department of Defense. But in his home state of Georgia, his political career hadn't yet found momentum, with a failed bid to be the state's insurance commissioner (under a promise to \"keep your insurance from going woke\") and a brief effort to run for Congress.\n\nThough his predecessor at the White House recently celebrated the significant win of the first U.S. crypto legislation to establish a law governing stablecoins, Hines left a major to-do list. When Congress returns from its summer break, Witt will have to get a handle on progress toward a Senate version of the House-passed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. Hines had also been closely monitoring developments in the formation of what the administration calls its Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — a project the industry has been eager to see progress on since an order from Trump earlier this year started work on it\n\n\"I love this community and all we’ve built together,\" Hines said in a farewell posting on X, surprising the industry by leaving after less than a year on the job. \"As I return to the private sector, I look forward to continuing my support for the crypto ecosystem as it thrives here in the United States.\"\n\nWitt re-posted that sentiment but hasn't yet made his own agenda clear. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on his promotion.\n\nTrump's most senior crypto policy chief, David Sacks, remains in his position.\n\nRead More: Why Doesn't the U.S. Have a Bitcoin Reserve, Yet?\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Donald Trump’s ‘Golden Age of Crypto’ Takes Shape With White House Working Group Report",
    "content": "Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency-friendly administration is set to usher in America’s “golden age of crypto,” quickly enabling digital asset trading at the federal level and also embracing decentralized finance (DeFi), according to a preview of a keenly-awaited report from the White House later today.\n\nMuch of what is highlighted in a concise fact sheet from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets is already in motion within Trump’s sweeping legislative agenda for crypto: the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and Clarity Act to oversee crypto markets.\n\nWhat is not included — at least in the report preview — is any detail on progress and plans for the federal government to stockpile of bitcoin or other other digital assets.\n\nStill, for those who have lived through more than a decade of regulatory uncertainty around cryptocurrencies, it remains striking to see a set of rules take shape in what is the crypto industry’s most important marketplace.\n\nThe summarized list of recommendations begins by asking that U.S. financial watchdogs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), having eliminated gaps in regulatory oversight of crypto, “immediately enable the trading of digital assets at the federal level by providing clarity to market participants on issues such as registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping.”\n\nThere is also recognition of the potential gains to be had from integrating DeFi technology – fast-moving, automated platforms for lending and borrowing crypto assets – into mainstream finance. Furthermore, the plan is to “allow innovative financial products to reach consumers without bureaucratic delays through the use of tools like safe harbors and regulatory sandboxes,” the preview said.\n\nThe banking industry has already been placed on notice by the Trump administration for what many took to calling “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” the backdoor denial of banking services to crypto firms. Looking ahead, the working group recommends setting clearer capital rules and creating transparency around how crypto firms can obtain master accounts or bank charters.\n\nStablecoins – seen as “strengthening the role of the U.S. dollar” – also take center stage in the report preview. Following President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act earlier this month establishing a federal framework for stablecoins, the working group urges agencies to implement it quickly.\n\nThe wholehearted promotion of USD-pegged stablecoins contrasts with the Trump administration’s dislike of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), with further calls for an Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act to codify the banning of CBDCs in the U.S.\n\nWhen it comes to taxation of crypto, the working group recommends that Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service review previously issued guidance on the tax treatment of activities like mining and staking. There’s also a call for guidance on corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) and de minimis receipts of digital assets, which would make it much easier to use crypto for payments.\n\n“By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the Golden Age of Crypto,” the president’s working group said.\n\nThe full report is expected to represent a complete accounting of the administration’s crypto strategy, as required by Trump’s executive order issued in his opening days in office.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "New White House Crypto Adviser Patrick Witt Calls Market Structure Bill Top Priority",
    "content": "President Donald Trump's new crypto guy, Patrick Witt, is picking up the baton from his predecessor Bo Hines in goading lawmakers to finish sweeping U.S. crypto policies and pushing regulators to put the new stablecoin law into practice, he said in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\nWorking under the administration's crypto czar, David Sacks, Witt is the new point of contact for crypto matters in the White House, having taken over after the brief tenure of his predecessor, Hines, who went on to work for stablecoin giant Tether. While Hines saw the conversion of Congress' stablecoin effort into law and was able to attend the White House ceremony to cement it, he left shortly after, leaving a lengthy crypto to-do list for Witt.\n\n\"There's no drop off here,\" said Witt, who was elevated to the job last month, just two weeks after the administration issued its wide-reaching strategy report for tackling U.S. crypto policy. \"We're keeping the pedal to the metal with all of the different initiatives on the legislative front and the interagency actions recommended in the report.\"\n\nWitt will speak at CoinDesk's Policy and Regulation event in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.\n\nIn his first interview since becoming the executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, he said his three top priorities are the Senate's work on market structure legislation, getting a speedy implementation of the stablecoin law known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act and setting up a federal crypto stockpile.\n\nOf the Senate's legislative work, seen last week when a draft bill emerged from Senate Banking Committee, Witt said this latest version has shown \"significant improvements.\"\n\n\"Generally, the reception has been positive,\" he noted, adding that those working on it are seeking input from Democrats, because several of them need to be on board for it to pass the 60-vote margin there. \"You know, our interest here is to make sure that we're listening to all parties in the space, that we're working to get something that moves the ball forward,\" said the former college quarterback for the Yale Bulldogs.\n\nThough the effort missed the August deadline initially set by Trump, Witt said the White House is \"keeping the pressure up from this side.\"\n\nHe said his office is in \"regular touch\" with the two committees working on the bill. The banking panel circulated its draft, but the Senate Agriculture Committee has been trailing. Both of them will need to finish legislation, open their efforts to member input and vote to forward them to the Senate floor before the Senate can take a final vote — where it will need hefty bipartisan support to advance. And Witt said that the market structure bill written by the Senate should be something the House of Representatives can approve without further haggling, even though the House already approved its own version, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act.\n\n\"We're confident that what comes out in the Senate is ultimately going to be a product that the House can also support,\" he said, which is what happened previously with the GENIUS Act — a Senate bill that the House of Representatives approved with a wide, bipartisan majority.\n\nSo far, one of the most urgent general objections voiced by congressional Democrats has been Trump's personal stake in the industry, which has reportedly gained the president and his family billions of dollars in revenue, investment gains and equity stakes. That conflict-of-interest argument is one Witt — much like his predecessor — dismissed as illegitimate.\n\n\"It's like saying any private citizen has a conflict when we strengthen America's economy,\" Witt argued. \"This is a win for America. It's not a win for any particular group of individuals.\"\n\nAmong the president's most high-profile crypto initiatives has been his order calling for the formation of a so-called Bitcoin Strategic Reserve that would hold government-seized bitcoin\nBTC\n$111,480.33\nas a long-term investment. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has been delving into how to establish a bitcoin stockpile and a separate reserve of all other types of cryptocurrency.\n\n\"It is a top priority for me, personally, for this office, for the administration,\" Witt said. He added it's not there yet, because the work \"presents some novel legal questions that we just need to get resolved.\" He said the White House is also aiming for legislative backing from Congress, so his office is working to figure out how to get to a \"passable\" bill that establishes the reserve in law.\n\nAnd he had no new details to share on how the administration might keep growing that bitcoin fund beyond the government bitcoin seizures it'll start the reserve with, only that the administration is contemplating \"some creative ways that we can get at accumulation with existing authorities.\"\n\nCompared with Hines, Witt has a deeper well of policy and executive-branch experience to draw from. He spent three years at McKinsey & Co., and served stints at the Office of Personnel Management in the first Trump presidency and some time at the Department of Defense, where he was a deputy undersecretary. That insider background may aid him in helping usher the federal regulators toward an implementation of the stablecoin law Trump already signed, he said.\n\n\"I know what that's like from the agencies,\" he said. \"So hopefully I can bring a good perspective to what's achievable there and how to approach it in the right way.\"\n\nBut the Senate's ongoing answer to the Clarity Act is the most urgent item on the agenda.\n\n\"GENIUS was a huge win, but as David Sacks likes to say, it addresses a relatively small portion of the overall crypto market,\" Witt said. \"This bill addresses the remaining — call it 80% of it. So this one's huge, and we want to make sure that we don't drop the ball, that we get it done.\"\n\nRead More: Who Is Patrick Witt, President Trump's Next Senior Adviser on Crypto?\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Digital Gold: A Story Still Being Written",
    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nAugust put a small dent in what remains a longer-term uptrend for digital assets. Bitcoin fell about 6.5% — its first monthly decline since March — after briefly touching a new all-time high of $125,000 mid-month. Ether, by contrast, extended its strong run, gaining nearly 19% and lifting its share of overall market capitalization to roughly 13%. This rotation from bitcoin into ether was also visible in ETFs: bitcoin funds saw rare net outflows, suggesting some profit-taking after this year’s extraordinary rally, while ether ETFs attracted heavy inflows that pushed assets under management to record levels. As a result, bitcoin dominance slipped to its lowest point since January, leaving the overall market capitalization of digital assets roughly flat on the month.\n\nDespite this sideways performance, market activity remained elevated. Spot trading volumes held above their twelve-month average — unusual for the typically quiet summer season — and derivatives markets were just as lively. Open interest in bitcoin and ether options reached new highs, and August set a record for BTC option trading volumes at $145 billion. Implied volatility stayed relatively subdued but did tick up toward month-end, hinting that the options market may be underestimating risk.\n\nWhile bitcoin paused, gold was on a tear. A perfect storm of falling rate expectations, persistent core inflation, widening trade deficits, a weaker dollar, geopolitical risks and mounting political uncertainty propelled the yellow metal to successive record highs. The dismissal of Fed Governor Lisa Cook by the Trump administration further stirred concerns over the long-term independence of the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields hardly budged, but gold — as a traditional hedge against inflation and systemic risk — jumped sharply. Bitcoin, however, traded lower on the day the news broke.\n\nThis raises the perennial question of whether bitcoin truly deserves the label “digital gold.” Its scarcity and libertarian origins support the analogy, but the data tells a more nuanced story. Short-term correlations between bitcoin and gold have been inconsistent, oscillating around 12% and 16% on both 30- and 90-day windows. Over longer horizons (180d), the average correlation is slightly higher, but still low. In other words, the two assets have not reliably moved together. However, since 2024, the average 180-day rolling correlation has shown a meaningful uptick to around 60%. The effect is visible on shorter horizons as well, though less pronounced. One reasonable interpretation is that the ‘digital gold’ narrative is beginning to gain firmer footing with investors as the asset class matures.\n\nIt is also worth remembering that gold itself has an imperfect track record as a macro and inflation hedge. It does not track consumer prices month by month, though over decades it has preserved purchasing power better than most assets. Research also shows that gold can serve as a safe haven during episodes of extreme equity stress, but not always, as its mixed relationship with the VIX illustrates.\n\nFor bitcoin, the narrative is still in flux. Some investors view it as a technology play; others see it as an emerging macro hedge. We believe the latter will prove more durable over time. Unlike other blockchains, Bitcoin’s limited scalability, rigid governance and lack of Turing completeness mean it is unlikely to become a multi-application platform. Other protocols are far better suited to that role. Instead, bitcoin’s long-term value proposition rests on its scarcity and neutrality— features that echo gold’s monetary role.\n\nOf course, such narratives take time to solidify. Gold required millennia to become widely accepted as a store of value. Bitcoin, by comparison, is only sixteen years old, yet it has already achieved remarkable levels of recognition and adoption. The “digital gold” analogy may not be fully supported by the data today, but it is far too early to dismiss it. If anything, history suggests that the story is still being written.\n\nLegal Disclaimer\n\nInformation presented, displayed, or otherwise provided is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as investment, legal, or tax advice, or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any interests in a fund or other investment product.

    "content": "Michigan-based mortgage lender LitFinancial on Wednesday debuted its U.S. dollar stablecoin, dubbed litUSD, on the Ethereum blockchain as the digital dollar movement is expanding beyond crypto natives.\n\nThe firm said it plans to use the token to cut funding costs and improve treasury management operations, while also exploring on-chain settlement of mortgage payments. That shift could allow loan performance to be tracked publicly, potentially reshaping liquidity in the secondary mortgage market.\n\nStablecoins, cryptocurrencies with prices anchored to fiat money like the U.S. dollar, are quickly growing in popularity as an alternative for payments, promising faster, cheaper transactions using blockchain rails.

    "title": "The GENIUS Act Won't Save the Dollar",
    "content": "Washington's GENIUS Act has crypto advocates celebrating clear stablecoin regulation. Politicians tout it as cementing dollar dominance for decades. The financial press frames it as America's masterstroke against competing currencies.\n\nThey're all missing the point. The GENIUS Act didn't create a protective moat around the dollar. It handed every other nation a blueprint for building their own digital currencies.\n\nThe GENIUS Act deserves credit for bringing much-needed clarity to U.S. stablecoin operations. Clear reserve requirements, regulatory oversight, and compliance frameworks remove much of the uncertainty that has plagued the sector for years. Circle's USDC and other major operators can finally build without constantly looking over their shoulders for regulatory changes.\n\nBut while Washington celebrates this supposed victory for dollar dominance, the real story unfolds differently. The GENIUS Act establishes a regulatory template that other nations are already adapting for their own currencies. Japan's JPYC initiative, Hong Kong's digital currency framework, and emerging programs across Latin America and Asia all borrow heavily from America's approach.\n\nThe framework standardizes USD stablecoins without addressing the fundamental inefficiency that limits their global adoption: local liquidity gaps. Today's cross-border payments still rely on expensive, multi-step currency conversions that eat 3-6% in foreign exchange costs.\n\nConsider a Brazilian worker in Japan trying to send money home. Under today's system, they must navigate a complex route of converting yen to dollars, purchasing USD stablecoins, and then converting to Brazilian reals. Each step incurs fees, delays, and counterparty risk.\n\nThis process makes little economic sense. Why should two non-dollar economies be forced through a USD intermediary?\n\nUSD stablecoins like USDC work brilliantly as bridge assets for institutional trading and DeFi applications. But for everyday cross-border payments between non-dollar economies, they introduce unnecessary complexity and cost, whereas neutral settlement layers enable cross-border liquidity without USD intermediation.\n\nThe GENIUS Act's global influence creates consequences its architects probably didn't anticipate. By providing a clear regulatory framework, it reduces the perceived risk of sovereign stablecoin projects worldwide. Countries no longer need to wonder whether digital currency regulation is feasible — they can adopt America's proven approach.\n\nJapan's Digital Agency has already announced plans for yen-backed stablecoins using compliance frameworks inspired by U.S. legislation. Hong Kong's monetary authority is developing similar standards for digital Hong Kong dollars. Brazil, Mexico, and other emerging economies are crafting their own versions.\n\nProgrammable foreign exchange between sovereign stablecoins could reduce cross-border costs below 0.1% while eliminating settlement delays. The vision resembles CLS Bank's multilateral settlement system, but without USD hegemony. Foreign exchange without dollar gatekeepers.\n\nThe GENIUS Act succeeds as policy precisely because other jurisdictions can replicate its approach. Regulatory harmony across major economies reduces compliance complexity for global stablecoin operators while enabling seamless cross-border integration.\n\nBut this same harmonization prevents any single currency from monopolizing digital payments. When every major economy offers compliant local stablecoins, market forces will determine adoption patterns rather than regulatory barriers.\n\nCircle's USDC benefits from first-mover advantages and deep DeFi integration, making it an excellent bridge asset for institutional applications. However, consumer payments will likely gravitate toward local stablecoins that eliminate foreign exchange friction and provide a familiar denomination.\n\nEuropean regulations under MiCA are creating similar frameworks for euro-denominated stablecoins. Asian financial centers are developing parallel structures for yen, won, and other regional currencies. Latin American countries are exploring peso and real-backed alternatives.\n\nThe result resembles traditional correspondent banking networks more than dollar hegemony. Each currency maintains its local utility while gaining programmable capabilities for international settlement.\n\nStablecoin adoption follows network effects similar to other digital platforms. Early users gravitate toward established options with deep liquidity and broad acceptance. This initially favors USD stablecoins due to their head start and existing DeFi integration.\n\nHowever, network effects also reward local utility. A Mexican business paying suppliers in pesos has little reason to hold dollar-denominated stablecoins beyond transaction settlement. Local stablecoins eliminate currency risk while providing the same programmable money benefits.\n\nThe strongest network effects emerge around specific use cases rather than abstract store-of-value properties. Payroll systems, supplier payments, and consumer remittances all benefit from denomination matching that eliminates foreign exchange exposure.\n\nMulti-currency stablecoin infrastructure resembles email protocols more than traditional monetary systems. Just as Gmail users can communicate with Outlook users through standardized protocols, peso stablecoins can settle with yen stablecoins through interoperable smart contracts.\n\nThe GENIUS Act represents a crucial step toward digital currency maturity, but not for the reasons its supporters claim. Rather than cementing dollar dominance, it validates the concept of sovereign digital currencies for every major economy.\n\nThe future financial system will likely feature dozens of compliant stablecoins representing major currencies, all interconnected through programmable settlement layers. Dollar stablecoins will play important roles in this ecosystem without necessarily dominating it.\n\nFor policymakers, the lesson is clear. Regulatory clarity accelerates innovation while protective barriers become obsolete.\n\nThe GENIUS Act didn't crown the dollar as king of digital money. It proved that the future belongs to whoever builds the best infrastructure for local currency digitization. That's a competition America can win, but only by competing on merit rather than relying on incumbent advantages.\n\nThe stablecoin revolution is just beginning, and it will be gloriously plural.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Top U.S. Banking Regulator Gould Says Crypto Debanking 'Is Real'",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — Jonathan Gould, in his opening weeks of running the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, left no uncertainty about his view of the systematic process to drop crypto people and businesses from banking relationships.\n\n\"Debanking is real,\" he told an audience Wednesday at CoinDesk's Policy and Regulation event in Washington, D.C. \"It is a real phenomenon,\" he noted, adding that he was hearing stories as recently as last week about people with corporate accounts being told \"we don't want your business here.\"\n\nIn his push to make the U.S. the crypto center of the world, President Donald Trump has appointed digital-assets-friendly regulators such as Gould to enact his executive orders to bolster the industry. Gould said he's been busy at the start of his tenure addressing debanking, reversing \"anti-crypto licensing conditions that we imposed\" and starting work on new stablecoin regulations.\n\nEarlier this week, Gould's OCC issued a statement saying it had taken actions \"to eliminate politicized or unlawful debanking in the federal banking system.\" While other industries with perceived riskiness or reputational problems have experienced banking difficulties, it was crypto insiders' struggle with banks that brought this issue to a head.\n\nHe said he's excited to start the \"big undertaking\" of writing the rules required under the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, under which the OCC will be a federal regulator for certain U.S. and all foreign stablecoin issuers whose tokens circulate here. The process by which crypto companies can license or charter as banks will get closer attention, he said, now that he's moved this week to make that function a direct report to his office.\n\n\"We have historically — or at least over the last few years — pursued more of a risk-elimination strategy where we wanted to kind of prevent the banks from getting involved in this at all,\" he said. Gould, a former executive at Bitfury, suggested that period in which the OCC was reluctant to allow banks to engage in crypto business is over.\n\nThe traditional banking system has been eyeing the stablecoin law nervously for its potential undermining of its core deposits business, but Gould said those fears are likely overblown, suggesting other deposit-similar products such as money market funds never killed off that mainstay of banking.\n\nRead More: Former Bitfury Exec Gould Confirmed to Take Over U.S. Banking Agency OCC\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nCrypto is superior to traditional finance. Unlike SWIFT, which can take days to process payments, newer blockchain networks achieve finality in mere seconds and have throughput sufficient for real-world mass adoption. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent projects stablecoins alone will hit $3.7 trillion by 2030. That’s the equivalent of Germany's GDP.\n\nDespite its technological edge, crypto has a major security problem. We're on track to lose around 4% of total value locked to hacks in 2025. In H1 alone, the industry lost over $2 billion. When annualized, that points to over $4 billion flowing into hackers' wallets this year.\n\nIf these losses were mirrored in traditional finance, the entire system would collapse. Yet crypto normalizes catastrophic loss rates while wondering why JPMorgan isn't moving their balance sheet on-chain.\n\nHacks cost more than you think\n\nThe real damage goes far beyond immediate theft. It’s a burden on the whole ecosystem and it gets priced in. Hacked protocols suffer a median 52% token price decline over six months, with the majority still showing price suppression half a year later.\n\nFor an industry aspiring to manage the world's wealth, this is an existential problem. No traditional financial market could survive with annual theft rates approaching 4%. To unlock the institutional flood gates and bring the next trillion on-chain, we must drive hack rates below 1% – now.\n\nThe North Koreans are stalking your development team\n\nThe moment a crypto project announces funding, North Korean hackers begin social engineering attacks on development teams. They've gotten scary good at it. Look at the Radiant Capital hack – $50 million gone because attackers compromised devices through malware that infected transaction signing.\n\nThe most painful part of all of this is that we have the tools to stop this, and they keep getting better. AI-driven monitoring systems can spot and resolve critical security issues before code is deployed, catching vulnerabilities that humans miss. Auditing services connect projects with elite Web3 security researchers to deliver tailored security reports. We have the tools, yet projects still ship with single pre-launch audits and pray. Protocols set rewards to identify vulnerabilities at 1% of funds at risk when they should be at 10%. Moreover, they skip monitoring because it seems expensive until they're explaining to users why $50 million vanished.\n\nHow to make crypto ready for primetime\n\nReducing hack rates below 1% is an engineering challenge we already know how to solve. Protocols must embrace comprehensive security stacks: continuous monitoring, meaningfully priced security rewards to encourage security researchers, formal verification for critical components and AI-powered threat detection. The cost is trivial compared to the potential losses.\n\nBanks and institutions see these hack rates. They run the math. And they conclude – correctly – that crypto isn't ready for prime time.\n\nDeFi survived every market crash with no systemic bad debt. We solved the technical problems. Security can’t be an afterthought. Either we adopt the security tools we've already built, or we watch institutional capital deploy elsewhere while hackers fund their operations with our losses.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nStablecoins: The Revolution in Global Money Transfers\n\nStablecoins are no longer just a bridge between crypto and fiat — they are becoming the rails of global commerce, writes Nonco CEO Fernando Martinez.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.

    "content": "St. Cloud Financial Credit Union (SCFCU), a Minnesota-based institution with over $400 million in assets, plans to roll out a proprietary stablecoin what it claims to be the first from a U.S. credit union.\n\nThe token, dubbed Cloud Dollar (CLDUSD) and developed with blockchain firm Metallicus and financial technology provider DaLand CUSO, is slated to debut as part of the credit union’s digital asset vault service in the last quarter of 2025.\n\n\"With CLDUSD, we're readying our shop for on-chain money movement — merchant payouts, member-to-member, institution-to-institution — at a fraction of card-network fees and with full transparency,\" said Chase Larson, EVP/CLO for St. Cloud Financial Credit Union.\n\nStablecoins are a fast-growing, $270 billion segment of cryptocurrencies, predominantly pegged to the U.S. dollar. They are widely used as trading pairs on exchanges and are increasingly popular as a cheaper, faster option for payments. Earlier this year, they received a boost in the U.S. when President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the country’s first major crypto law, into effect.\n\nSCFCU's initiative highlights how smaller financial institutions are experimenting with blockchain tools to compete with fintechs. CLDUSD differs from mainstream stablecoin offerings like USDT or USDC as it connects directly to the credit union’s banking system.\n\nThe token will be issued on Metallicus' blockchain banking stack the Metal Blockchain and integrated through DaLand CUSO’s Coin2Core software, which ties blockchain services to existing credit union infrastructure. The design aims to keep deposits on-platform while giving members a way to move money instantly and at lower cost in a regulated manner.\n\n\"Credit unions can't afford to watch digital assets evolve without them members need trusted institutions to navigate this space safely,\" Jeff Levesque, CEO of DaLand CUSO, said in a statement.\n\nRead more: Washington’s Crypto Pivot Isn’t About Silicon Valley.

    "content": "Clear Street initiated coverage of Bakkt (BKKT) with a buy rating and a $14 price target, implying 44% upside after a steep year-to-date decline, the broker said in a research report Tuesday.\n\nThe shares have fallen over 60% this year versus an 11% gain for the S&P 500 stock index. The stock was 0.7% higher, around $9.83, in early trading Wednesday.\n\nBakkt has shed non-core units like Loyalty and Custody to streamline into a blockchain-native payments platform, trading at just 2.9x projected 2027 EV/EBITDA, the report noted.\n\nIts business now rests on two pillars: Crypto Services for institutions and its Digital Transfer and Remittance (DTR) platform, which builds stablecoin payment infrastructure. With strong regulatory footing, a lean cost structure, and higher-margin stablecoin rails, Bakkt is positioned to capture share in the $190 trillion cross-border payments market, analysts led by Brian Dobson wrote.\n\nClear Street projects 14% annual revenue growth through 2027, with DTR driving both scale and profitability.\n\nThe broker noted that stablecoin transactions offer nearly double the margin of crypto services, pushing gross profit growth at 66% annually. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to turn positive by early 2026 and hit $49 million in 2027, supported by a $60 million cost reset.\n\nDTR is slated to launch in 36 countries by late 2025 and expand to 90-plus in 2026, with transaction volume forecast to reach $2.6 billion by 2027, the analysts wrote.\n\nBakkt’s institutional-first model avoids reliance on retail crypto adoption, targeting regulated partners like remittance firms and neobanks, the broker said, and Its BitLicense and 50-plus state money transmitter licenses provide one of the strongest compliance frameworks in the U.S., enabling rapid scaling.\n\nWith high-margin stablecoin flows, operating leverage, and a re-rating to peer multiples, Clear Street sees Bakkt as an underappreciated stablecoin infrastructure play with material upside.\n\nRival broker Benchmark initiated coverage of Bakkt with a buy rating and a $13 target on Monday.\n\nRead more: Bakkt Reboots With Fresh Strategy; Initiate at Buy with $13 Price Target: Benchmark\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "‘The Ingredients Are All There’: Solana May Be Set to Soar, Says Bitwise",
    "content": "Solana has been a recent outperformer among major cryptos — ahead 24% over the past month — but that could just be precursor to an epic end of year run, writes Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan.\n\n\"For the last 18 months, the recipe for strong returns in crypto has been clear,\" said Hougan. \"Take one part ETP inflows, add strong corporate treasury purchases, and voilà — you get big returns.\"\n\nHougan reminded that \"recipe\" sent bitcoin from $40,000 to its current level and ether more than tripling, and the same setup is forming around SOL.\n\nSeven major asset managers — including Bitwise itself, alongside Grayscale, Fidelity, and VanEck — have filed to launch spot Solana ETPs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is due to rule on them by October 10. If even a few are approved, retail and institutional investors could soon be buying SOL the same way they would a stock.\n\nThat’s not the only tailwind, said Hougan. This past weekend, a previously quiet publicly traded microcap, Forward Industries (FORD), announced it had raised $1.65 billion from crypto investment heavyweights Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital.\n\nThe company’s playbook is simple: buy SOL, stake it, and generate yield — turning solana itself into a revenue-generating asset on a public balance sheet. At the helm is Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin and one of Solana’s earliest champions.\n\nHougan likens Samani to the Michael Saylor of Bitcoin or Tom Lee of Ethereum — visible, vocal, and capable of turning a technical narrative into a mainstream headline. Still, Solana has to earn the attention.\n\nIts pitch is speed. Unlike Ethereum, which uses additional layers to scale, Solana runs everything on one chain. A new upgrade — soon to go live — will shrink transaction finality time from 12 seconds to 150 milliseconds. Transaction fees remain under a cent.\n\nThose gains do come with tradeoffs, Hougan allowed. Solana’s critics argue that its structure is more centralized than other blockchains, potentially leaving it exposed to network failures. Supporters counter that it’s the only chain fast and cheap enough to support high-volume use cases — like tokenized assets or stablecoins — at a global scale.\n\nAnd growth is happening. Solana is now third in stablecoin liquidity and fourth in tokenized assets, with asset volume up 140% this year, said Hougan.\n\nThen there’s its size. With a market cap of $116 billion, Solana is still a small fish compared to Bitcoin’s $2.2 trillion or Ethereum’s $519 billion. That means smaller inflows can move the needle in bigger ways. According to Hougan, Forward Industries’ $1.65 billion could have the same impact on SOL as a $33 billion investment would on BTC.\n\nThat’s why he’s watching closely. “My suggestion?” Hougan wrote. “Keep your eye on Solana.”\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Crypto Prices Buoyed by Soft PPI Data; Bitcoin Tops $113K",
    "content": "Soft U.S. inflation data for August is — at least temporarily — pushing crypto prices higher early Wednesday.\n\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures inflation at the wholesale level, fell 0.1% month-over-month in August, compared to analyst estimates of a 0.3% rise and the previous month's 0.9% increase. Year-over-year, PPI grew by 2.6%, down from 3.1% previously and sharply lower than forecasts for 3.3%.\n\nThe core PPI, which strips out food and energy costs, also fell 0.1% in August verus a forecats rise of 0.3% and July's rise of 0.7%. Year-over-year core PPI rose just 2.8% against estimates for 3.5% and July's 3.4%.\n\nReaction in crypto markets was swift, with bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,292.58\nrising to $113,700 at press time, ahead more than 1% over the past 24 hours. Ether\nETH\n$4,525.59\nrose by a similar amount and Solana's SOL\nSOL\n$229.15\ncontinued recent outperformance, up 3.3% to $224.\n\nThis latest PPI reading followed July's blowout PPI increase that reignited inflation concerns amid a quickly weakening labor market. Traders will monitor tomorrow's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report, a key data point to asses ahead of the Fed's interest rate decision next week.\n\n\"That's exactly the PPI data we should cheer for, assuming that it will help to suppress CPI inflation, end the recent streak of re-inflation, and allow the Fed to focus explicitly on recent labor market weakness,\" said Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, in an X post.\n\nAll things being equal, it's generally assumed that easier monetary policy is good for risk assets, crypto among them.\n\nThe past month has seen Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell flip from hawk to dove and now a string of weak economic reports possibly pointing to the need for a series of central bank rate cuts. And yet, bitcoin has struggled — rising as the news from Powell or the reports hit, but then pulling back just as quickly.\n\nBitcoin's price action has been particularly perplexing as gold has behaved exactly the way investors might expect — pushing to what seems like new record highs with each fresh dovish news item.\n\nWhile traders continue to overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at its policy meeting next week, they've upped bets on a possible 50 basis point move. According to CME FedWatch, the odds of a 50 point cut have now risen to 10% versus 7% prior to the PPI report and 0% one week ago.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (all times ET unless stated otherwise)\n\nJust 10 days after the U.S. Department of Commerce started posting economic data on a selection of blockchains, the reliability of its data is being questioned by some observers.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics disclosed a startling figure: The economy created nearly 1 million fewer jobs than reported in the year ended March. The record revision calls into question earlier optimism about the strength of the labor market, casting doubt on all risk-on positions traders took in the past year or so.\n\nMarkets interpreted the downward revisions as another sign the Fed will introduce aggressive easing in the coming months. One popular Polymarket trader is betting that the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points on Sept. 17.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$123,185.20\nis trading above $112,000, having reached lows of around $110,800 during North American trading hours yesterday. European stocks are higher with the S&P 500 futures pointing to a positive open later Wednesday.\n\nStill, caution may be warranted for two reasons: The U.S. producer price and consumer price indices due in the next 24 hours are likely to show that inflation remains elevated and well above the Fed's 2% target. Stagflation concerns may grip the market, weakening the case for aggressive Fed easing, if these data sets blow past expectations.\n\nThe second reason is that the liquidity tightening is underway.\n\n\"Liquidity is tightening as the Treasury General Account rises and the reverse repo facility drains, pushing reserve balances lower,\" Mott Capital Management said. \"With SOFR climbing, spreads widening, and credit stress showing up, the market may soon face renewed pressure on risk assets.\"\n\nThis is probably the reason why put options tied to bitcoin and ether continue to trade pricier than calls on Deribit, reflecting downside concerns.\n\nIn other news, crypto staking platform Kiln said it is exiting its Ethereum validators due to an exploit incident that affected SwissBorg.\n\nReal-world asset protocols continue to grow, with a total value locked of now over $15 billion.\n\nLastly, a single entity earned $200 million from the MYX airdrop. Talk about windfall gain.

Keep an eye on DAT premia compressing and the risk of negative convexity on the downside,” Fan said, referring to the many digital asset treasuries held by U.S.-listed companies that have sprouted in recent months.\n\nMacro could break the stalemate. “Markets are entering a decisive week as US data and central bank decisions converge,” said Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM, in an email.\n\nHe added a cooler CPI and any downward revision to payrolls would strengthen the case for Fed cuts, weaken the dollar and could lift alternative assets, while a sticky print would argue for patience and raise volatility across cryptoThat push and pull is mirrored in positioning.\n\n“Investors are caught between turning bearish and risking missed upside, or buying the dip too early,” said Justin d’Anethan, founder of Poly Max Investment. He noted chatter about Strategy’s potential S&P 500 inclusion faded, denting the corporate treasury meme, yet public companies now hold about 1 million BTC.\n\n“In the bigger picture, BTC consolidating around 111K is a fine place for long-term believers. Pullbacks of 10% to 15% inside bull runs have not historically broken the trend,” d’Anethan said.\n\nFor traders, the checklist is straightforward.

    "content": "Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko has called on the country’s financial sector to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency and cash payments, calling them essential tools for economic resilience.\n\nLukashenko’s words came during a meeting with central bank and commercial banking leaders, as the country faces sweeping sanctions over its support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and alleged human rights violations.\n\n“Today, cryptocurrency-based transactions are more active than ever, and their role in facilitating payments is growing,” Lukashenko said according to local media. To him, the market now requires regulatory oversight, which he instructed the financial sector to move forward with.\n\nHe criticized banks for mistreating customers, including forcing insurance on borrowers or refusing old dollar bills, and said any such abuses would lead to disciplinary action starting in 2026.\n\n“Don't think only in terms of profit,” Lukashenko said, pointing to rising fees, misuse of bank profits, and questionable lending practices.\n\nLukashenko called for the rollout of an instant payment system by the end of the year, to allow for real-time bank transfers in a bid to improve liquidity. To keep trade flowing amid the sanctions, he pointed to potential cryptocurrency-based turnarounds.\n\nBelarus’ gold and foreign exchange reserves reached $12.5 billion according to the news outlet, buoyed by gold’s rising price.\n\nEarlier this month, Lukashenko pressed regulators to finalize a framework for cryptocurrencies as it moved to cement the country as a crypto-friendly hub. Belarus’ growing embrace of crypto comes amid a sharp de-dollarization trend that has seen it sell $30 million in foreign cash per day this year according to the report.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Bitcoin Retakes $112K, SOL Hits 7-Month High as Economists Downplay Recession Fears",
    "content": "Asset prices reflected a buoyant mood on Wednesday, with bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,183.96\nreclaiming $112,000 and European stocks rising at the open, as analysts increasingly downplayed fears of stagflation and recession triggered by horrible U.S. jobs data.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics published a shocking update: The economy likely added 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the 12 months through March 2025.\n\nThink of it this way: for over a year, equity and crypto market bulls took risks, confident that a healthy labour market would keep the economy going despite sticky inflation. That confidence was shaken on Tuesday, and BTC quickly dropped from $113,000 to $110,800.\n\nSome market participants viewed the BLS revision as evidence of an impending recession. However, Michael Englund, principal director and chief economist at Action Economics, said the data revealed very little about the business cycle or the state of the economy.\n\n\"These revisions are telling us more about the secular trajectory for the size of the U.S. labor force rather than where we are in the business cycle, so it really hasn't raised our perceived risk of recession even if it tells us that trend-growth for monthly payrolls is now likely a two-digit gain, measured in thousands, rather than a three-digit gain. We now assume trend-growth for the labor force of 90,000 going forward, rather than the 150,000-200,000 gains seen through most of the current expansion,\" Englund said in an email to CoinDesk.\n\nHe explained that the sharp growth in the U.S. labor force post-COVID, which outpaced economists' expectations, was largely driven by a net annual in-migration of roughly one million people. Now that has shifted to net out-migration, estimated between one and two million.\n\n\"This shift to a lower, secular growth path for the labor force implies slower growth in civilian employment as measured by household surveys and nonfarm payrolls from establishment surveys going forward,\" Englund said.\n\nFinancial markets appear to share that view, as European stocks opened higher today, with BTC back above $112,000. Altcoins such as ether\nETH\n$4,518.91\n,\nXRP\n$2.8927\n, and\nDOGE\n$0.2557\nhave erased a significant potion of Tuesday's drop. Meanwhile, Solana's SOL\nSOL\n$228.11\nhas jumped to $222, the highest since Feb. 1. The S&P 500 futures traded 0.3% higher, with European stocks posting gains at the open.\n\nThe BLS revisions and the impending U.S. CPI data, which is expected to show inflation sticky at around 3% (well above the Fed's 2% target), have reinstated fears of stagflation, a situation characterized by persistent high inflation combined with high unemployment and stagnant economic growth. Stagflation is widely seen as the worst outcome for risk assets, including bitcoin.\n\nHowever, fears that the economy is heading into stagflation seem overdone, according to Marc Chandler, Managing Partner and Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, who noted that the U.S. GDP is still running above the Federal Reserve's \"trend estimate\" or a non-inflationary pace.\n\n\"I think stagflation is still exaggerated. The Atlanta Fed tracker still has the GDP well above the Fed's trend estimate, its non-inflationary pace.\n\nYes, inflation is a bit elevated, and it is likely to be more so with the August CPI print on Thursday. However, Fed officials, such as Waller and Bowman, want to look through tariff-related increases,\" Chandler told CoinDesk.\n\n\"It seems to me clear that the Fed will resume its easing course next week,\" he added.\n\nTraders have pencilled in a 91% chance of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points to 4% on Sept. 17, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Some investment banks and traders are anticipating a larger 50-basis-point rate cut.\n\nThese easing expectations could further strengthen if Wednesday's U.S. producer price index (PPI) and Thursday's consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly signal disinflation, which would help risk assets remain bid over the near term.\n\nThat said, increased expectations could set the stage for disappointment.\n\n\"I think the CPI print this week will give us more context... If the market expects 50bps points to be cut, but FOMC Sept 17th only delivers 25bps... we'll get a sell-off,\" Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata, told CoinDesk.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has expanded its xStocks offering to millions of clients across the European Union, providing on-chain access to U.S. equities to investors in the region.\n\nThe expansion enables eligible European investors to trade tokenized versions of popular U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly through the Kraken app.\n\n\"Expanding xStocks to the European Union was a natural next step for Kraken, given our dedicated growth strategy and market presence here. For too long, it's been unnecessarily challenging to gain exposure to U.S. markets, and with xStocks we’re removing many of the barriers,” Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of consumer, said in the announcement shared with CoinDesk.\n\nTokenized stocks, also known as xStocks, developed in partnership with the Swiss Fintech firm Backed, are blockchain-based representations of real-world stocks or ETFs.\n\nThese tokens mirror the value of the underlying stock and can be traded or held just like any other cryptocurrency in your wallet. These instruments address the longstanding challenges faced by global investors trying to access the U.S. stock market, which has traditionally been difficult and fraught with friction.\n\nWith xStocks, EU-based investors can trade tokenized certificates that track the prices of popular U.S. equities, eliminating the need for traditional brokerages or intermediaries. Investors will maintain complete control over their assets, allowing seamless movement across compatible platforms and self-custody.\n\nAdditionally, xStocks can be integrated into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, serving as composable financial building blocks that enhance users' flexibility and participation in modern digital markets.\n\nKraken’s rollout of 24/5 xStocks trading in the EU is consistent with the growing interest in blockchain-based financial infrastructure and reflects broader industry trends toward decentralization, transparency, and democratization of global financial markets.\n\nAccording to Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and McKinsey & Company, the global tokenized asset market is expected to be worth trillions of dollars by the 2030s.\n\nThe tokenized stocks operate as SPL tokens on the Solana blockchain, known for fast and low-cost transactions, with plans underway to expand support to BEP-20 blockchains and Ethereum’s mainnet. This multi-chain approach aims to integrate xStocks deeper into the booming DeFi ecosystem.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Asia Morning Briefing: Bitcoin’s Calm Masks Market Tension Ahead of Fed and CPI",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\n\nBTC is pinned near $111,000 with volatility compressed to multi-month lows, the kind of calm that tends to precede decisive moves. Traders know what could break the lull: September’s U.S. inflation data and the Fed’s rate decision a week later.\n\nPrediction markets are leaning heavily toward easing. Polymarket bettors are assigning an 82% chance of a 25-basis-point cut on Sept. 17, leaving only slim odds for a deeper move or no change. Beyond that, October expectations are fractured, with nearly even probabilities for another cut or a pause. That divergence explains why volatility, though absent now, is unlikely to stay that way.\n\n“Markets often look calm just before they move. Bitcoin is trading in one of its tightest ranges in months, and volatility across crypto has compressed to multi-month lows,” said Gracie Lin, OKX Singapore CEO. “With U.S. inflation data like Core CPI out on Sept. 11 and the Fed’s much-anticipated rate decision just ahead, this quiet period is setting the stage for the next decisive move. Whether the catalyst is an upside inflation surprise or a dovish signal from the Fed, what’s clear is that the absence of volatility is rarely permanent in digital assets; history shows the market will find its next direction soon enough.”\n\nIf a cut pulls money-market returns lower, the opportunity cost of sitting in cash rises, which is the pivot market maker Enflux says could send flows toward crypto.\n\n“The real debate now is not if cuts come, but whether liquidity deployment shifts into BTC, ETH, and even riskier assets,” the firm told CoinDesk.\n\nIn other words, the Fed’s cut may grab headlines, but the real trade is whether sidelined cash rotates into digital assets — a shift that could fuel the return of volatility.\n\nBTC: Bitcoin has dipped slightly intraday, trading between approximately $110,812 and $113,237, reflecting short-term volatility amid shifting investor sentiment and broader crypto market dynamics.\n\nETH: ETH is modestly up intraday, with a range between roughly $4,279 and $4,379, signaling steady demand and some renewed investor interest. Range, however, is limited with modest ETF flows and traders awaiting the Fed's next move.\n\nGold: Gold is rallying to record highs, fueled by mounting expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a weakening U.S. dollar, and renewed safe-haven demand.\n\nNikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks opened mostly higher Wednesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.2%, as investors awaited China’s August inflation data showing an expected 0.2% CPI drop and a smaller 2.9% PPI decline.\n\nS&P 500: U.S. stocks closed at record highs Tuesday, with the S&P 500 up 0.27% to 6,512.61, as investors looked past a record payroll revision that cut 911,000 jobs from prior figures.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Shiba Inu developers said on Tuesday the long-delayed LEASH v2 migration will begin in the coming days after security firm Hexens signed off on the new token and its migration contract.\n\nThe approval closes months of uncertainty caused by a hidden flaw in the original LEASH code that undermined its fixed-supply design, as the team had earlier noted.\n\nLEASH was initially marketed as a scarce asset. However, the contract included a rebase mechanism that could alter supply under certain conditions, even after developers claimed the keys were burned.\n\nThe contract retained a “hidden-in-plain-sight” control path, with pre-authorized proxies still able to trigger supply changes. The flaw dated back to 2020 and was eventually exploited, eroding confidence in what was supposed to be a hard-capped token - causing a 20% jump in token supply earlier this year.\n\nThe new version is intended to close that loophole permanently. Hexens, known for audits of Polygon zkEVM and LayerZero, examined both the LEASH v2 token and its migration system.\n\nDevelopers said the contract cannot mint new tokens under any circumstances following the new fixes, and that the full supply of v2 has already been minted into a multisignature wallet.\n\nDuring migration, v1 tokens will be locked or burned while v2 tokens are released from the multisig in proportion to each holder’s entitlement.\n\nThe redesign is based on OpenZeppelin ERC-20 libraries to keep the token simple and auditable. Any advanced features, such as privacy layers, would be added later through wrappers rather than changes to the base token.\n\nSHIB prices are down 1% over the past 24 hours, in line with a flat broader crypto market\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "A leading trader on decentralized betting platform Polymarket, who goes by the name JustWakingUp, is wagering that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) next week.\n\nAccording to X handle Polymarket Whales, JustWakingUp is the platform’s most prolific trader, boasting nearly $400 million in total trading volume to date and profits exceeding $2 million.\n\nThe trader has placed a $15,000 bet that the Fed will reduce rates by 50 bps to 3.75% next week and is already showing a 3% gain on the position as of writing. The trader stands to make roughly $226,000 if the Fed does cut rates by 5 bps.\n\nThe market, however, largely expects the Fed to deliver a 25 basis point cut next week, with the CME’s FedWatch Tool assigning a 91% probability to such an outcome.\n\nThat said, the odds of a jumbo 50 bps cut have surged to nearly 10% following Friday’s disappointing August jobs report, reflecting growing expectations of more aggressive easing. BlackRock and StanChart have called for a 50 bps cut.\n\nAdding to market expectations, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Tuesday that the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ending March 2025 than previously estimated, marking the largest annual downward revision on record.\n\nTraders are now closely watching Wednesday’s U.S. Producer Price Index and Thursday’s Consumer Price Index data releases.

The contrast underscored how investor attention is increasingly tied to the role mining infrastructure could play in the AI boom rather than just bitcoin’s price action.\n\nLeading was a 22% gain for Bitfarms (BITF), while shares of Cipher Mining (CIFR) rose 20%. IREN (IREN), Hut 8 (HUT), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and TeraWulf (WULF) were up mid-teens percentages.\n\nInterestingly, the weakest sector performer was MARA Holdings, which in recent months has positioned itself as more of a bitcoin treasury company, rather than high performance computing player. Shares of MARA were higher by just 4% on Tuesday.\n\nThe outsized moves reflect the industry’s shifting reality. For years, mining profitability was largely dictated by bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle, when block rewards are cut in half. That rhythm no longer dominates, leaving companies exposed to surging power costs, relentless hardware production, and intensifying competition. Hardware makers like Bitmain continue to expand, adding pressure to an already crowded field.\n\nAt the same time, AI is reshaping the business model. Miners with large energy footprints and advanced computing infrastructure are exploring ways to lease capacity to hyperscalers or pivot toward data center services.

    "title": "Dems Respond to GOP's Crypto Market Structure Bill With Framework of Priorities",
    "content": "Senate Democrats unveiled their own framework for market structure legislation to define how cryptocurrencies fit into current or future regulatory frameworks in the U.S., including how the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission should oversee the digital asset sector.\n\nThe lawmakers' framework, published Tuesday, listed seven \"key pillars,\" including calling for fair regulation that protects consumers and investors, defining how digital assets fit into different regulators' jurisdictions and \"preventing corruption and abuse.\" Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee have already released multiple drafts of their own market structure bill, which Committee Chairman Tim Scott said should be through the Senate by the end of September.\n\nSenators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Catherine Cortez Masto, Ben Ray Lujan, John Hickenlooper, Raphael Warnock, Adam Schiff, Andy Kim, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Angela Alsobrooks signed onto the framework. All of these lawmakers had previously voted in favor of the GENIUS Act, a law regulating stablecoins in the U.S., suggesting these are members who may be willing to back this more consequential legislation, though Hickenlooper and Kim had voted against a procedural motion advancing the bill. Gillibrand has previously sponsored numerous bills with Republican Cynthia Lummis addressing crypto. Any bill will need bipartisan support to advance through the Senate.\n\n\"We owe it to the millions of Americans who participate in this market to create clear rules of the road that protect consumers and safeguard our markets,\" the lawmakers said in a statement. \"We also must ensure that digital assets are not used to finance illicit activities or to line the pockets of politicians and their families.\"\n\nTheir framework contends the existing regulatory regime in the U.S. has \"hobbled both innovation and consumer protection,\" and it called for legislation to clarify how digital assets that are not securities fit into the rules and how they would be regulated. The seven pillars include \"closing the gap in the spot market\" for cryptocurrencies that aren't securities; clarifying regulatory jurisdiction; bringing issuers into a regulatory framework; bringing other platforms into a framework; blocking illicit finance; preventing corruption through crypto and \"ensuring fair, effective regulation.\"\n\nNew White House crypto adviser Patrick Witt said in a CoinDesk interview this week that the GOP-driven effort has been seeking input from Democrats to ensure a bill that can pass the Senate. This document may stand as the most significant response so far, giving both parties something more concrete to talk about.\n\nThe 6-page document notes that the CFTC does not currently have the resources to properly oversee the crypto spot markets, and it calls for both that agency and the SEC to come up with new frameworks for overseeing their respective portions of the digital asset sector.\n\nIt also called for legislation to have all digital asset platforms register as \"financial institutions\" with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a U.S. Treasury Department branch tasked with tracking illicit finance.\n\nOne sticking point may come through the sixth pillar, titled \"preventing corruption and abuse.\"\n\nThe section said U.S. President Donald Trump \"has turned to digital asset projects to enrich himself and his family,\" and said legislation should \"limit elected officials and their families from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets while in office\" and require disclosures.\n\nSimilar arguments contributed to a hold-up in the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year, but the bill ultimately passed without any provisions blocking Trump or his family from engaging in crypto.\n\nIn a statement, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, said, \"producing a new crypto regulatory regime requires legislation that can pass both the House and the Senate.\"\n\n\"So far, instead of working with us, Republicans have produced two partisan drafts — including a recent proposal that reportedly reflects secret feedback from industry and other stakeholders that Republicans refuse to share with Committee Democrats, or the public,\" she said, adding that that feedback should be shared publicly.\n\nRead more: New White House Crypto Adviser Patrick Witt Calls Market Structure Bill Top Priority\n\nUPDATE (Sept. 9, 2025, 18:33 UTC): Adds Warren statement.\n\nCORRECTION (Sept. 15, 2025, 23:10 UTC): Corrects that Hickenlooper and Kim voted in favor of the GENIUS Act's final passage. They voted against cloture.\n\nMore For You\n\nU.S. Senators Get 250K Letters Calling for Protection of Stablecoin Yields\n\nStand With Crypto encouraged the messaging from its massive online list of advocates, asking the lawmakers to leave the GENIUS Act alone.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Shares of CoreWeave (CRWV) rose as much as 9% on Monday morning after the company announced it’s launching a venture capital arm focused on early-stage artificial intelligence startups.\n\nThe stock was higher by 4.5% as midday U.S. hours approached..\n\nThe new fund, called CoreWeave Ventures, will focus on investing in startups building tools, infrastructure or applications for AI. The company didn’t disclose how much capital would be committed but framed the effort as an extension of its broader mission to support high-performance computing for machine learning and generative AI.\n\n“Our aim with CoreWeave Ventures is to give other audacious, like-minded founders the support they need to drive technical advancements and bring to market the next class of innovation,” said Brannin McBee, co-founder and chief development officer at CoreWeave.\n\nCoreWeave specializes in cloud computing optimized for AI workloads, offering access to Nvidia GPUs and fast storage to clients ranging from large enterprises to research labs. It went public earlier this year at $40 per share and surged to a high of $187 in June before pulling back.\n\nThe launch of CoreWeave Ventures comes during a busy period for cloud infrastructure firms focused on AI. On Monday, Nebius, another player in the “neocloud” space, signed a five-year, $19.4 billion agreement with Microsoft to supply computing power. That announcement sent several AI and data center stocks higher, adding momentum to the sector.\n\nCoreWeave is also in the process of acquiring bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) in a $9 billion all-stock deal. The merger, announced in July, is still subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.\n\nFor AI startups, the arrival of another specialized investor could offer an alternative to generalist VC firms or hyperscaler-linked capital. And for CoreWeave, it’s a chance to bet on the ecosystem it helps power — and maybe get early access to the next breakthrough.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Washington’s Crypto Pivot Isn’t About Silicon Valley. It’s About Treasuries",
    "content": "Much ado has been made about U.S. President Donald Trump’s open-armed embrace of crypto.\n\nOne theory is that the White House’s friendliness toward digital assets is a favor to Silicon Valley donors, a gesture to innovation-friendly constituencies. Another is that it reflects an administrative belief in the efficiency gains that blockchain can bring to payments.\n\nBoth explanations may hold some truth. But they miss a more pressing, and under-analyzed, reason: America has a debt problem. And the challenge isn’t just how much the U.S. owes ($37 trillion and counting), either — it’s who will keep buying that debt.\n\nForeign buyers of U.S. Treasuries — long the dependable stalwarts of American borrowing — are pulling back. Among other examples, China’s holdings dropped to their lowest since 2009, while Japan, once the largest foreign holder, has been trimming too.\n\nWith interest rates still above 4%, Washington is scrambling for new sources of demand.\n\nTreasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who describes himself first and foremost as America’s bond salesman, believes he has found a steady source in crypto. His unlikely new customers: stablecoins.\n\nStablecoins — digital tokens pegged to the dollar — now represent one of the fastest-growing sources of U.S. debt demand.\n\nTo understand why this is significant, it’s important first to understand the math: every $1 deposited into stablecoins results in roughly $0.90 flowing into Treasuries. Compare that with U.S. bank deposits, where only ~11% of funds ultimately cycle into Treasuries. The difference is stark. Put another way, the game plan is quite simple: every dollar that flows out of a bank deposit and into a stablecoin yields about $0.79 in net new Treasury demand.\n\nThis explains how Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, became a top-20 holder of Treasuries — with over $125bn in U.S. debt. Circle, which issues USDC, is not far behind. Together, they now hold more Treasuries than some sovereigns, ranking around the 18th largest holder worldwide.\n\nIn short: stablecoins are not just a tool for crypto traders. They’ve become a uniquely efficient channel for Treasury demand.\n\nIt seems like no accident, then, that the Trump administration has cleared the runway for a domestic stablecoin boom.\n\nThe GENIUS Act, passed in July, requires stablecoins to be backed one-for-one with cash or short-term Treasuries — effectively channeling inflows into government debt. A companion Digital Asset Market Clarity Act promises the first federal rulebook for crypto investment. Bessent himself has not been shy about this topic, publicly calling stablecoins a way to boost demand for U.S. government debt and cement U.S. Dollar dominance globally.\n\nOther steps from the administration seem to support this theory and strategy as well. A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and broader U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, seeded with crypto seized by law enforcement, signaled that the government views digital assets as part of its financial toolkit. Additionally, a recent executive order barred banks from blocking crypto transactions, lowering friction for both retail and institutions. Another rule change opened the door for 401(k) retirement savings to invest in digital assets, creating a powerful new capital channel.\n\nEach initiative reduces the perceived risk of crypto, draws in new participants, and ultimately pushes more dollars into stablecoins — and by extension, into Treasuries.\n\nFor all its momentum, Bessent’s strategy is not without hazards. Stablecoins are still small relative to the $50 trillion U.S. financial system, and their demand can be fickle. If sentiment turns or crypto adoption stalls, the Treasury bid could shrink just as quickly as it has grown, leaving Washington once again searching for buyers.\n\nEven if growth continues, the mechanics of stablecoin reserves carry distortive effects. Because issuers are restricted to holding only cash and short-term Treasuries, their rise channels demand almost exclusively to the front end of the yield curve. That concentration tilts issuance away from longer-dated bonds and may reshape the maturity profile of U.S. debt in ways policymakers weren’t expecting.\n\nFinally, banks are unlikely to cede ground quietly. Deposit flight into stablecoins is a direct threat to their business model, which depends on capturing the yield on U.S. dollars. That is precisely why the GENIUS Act prohibits issuers from offering yield-bearing tokens. But workarounds are already being explored, setting up a competitive fight over who earns the yield on the dollars backing the stablecoin.\n\nThe prevailing narrative is that Trump’s crypto pivot is about innovation or pandering to Silicon Valley. The reality looks more pragmatic — and more urgent. Stablecoins are being positioned as a Trojan horse for Treasury demand, one that channels global dollars into U.S. debt more efficiently than banks or foreign sovereigns.\n\nWhether this gambit succeeds or inflates another bubble remains to be seen. But it reframes the crypto debate: in Washington’s eyes, stablecoins are not a sideshow. They may be the ballast keeping America’s debt machine afloat.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.\n\nMore For You\n\nSpeculative Retail Trading is Good for Financial Markets, Actually\n\nFighting speculation is fighting reality, Stocktwits CEO and co-founder Howard Lindzon argues.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Everybody knows it's true,” Hoskinson said in an interview with CoinDesk TV at the Rare Evo conference in Las Vegas. “Yet they all try to continue making the system go because it's just too profitable.”\n\nWhile it may sound like a harsh criticism, Hoskinson is putting his money where his mouth is: He is pouring $200 million investment into a medical center in Gillette, Wyoming, that now serves about one-third of the town’s population.\n\nHis vision for his multi-million dollar investment? “If they can't pay, don't charge 'em,” he said.\n\nSo, what are the main issues with the current health-care system that made him pour millions into a new type of system? According to Hoskinson, it is how doctors are paid.\n\n\"All the financial incentives are just horrible and wrong inside health care,\" he told CoinDesk TV, using an example of how doctors are incentivized to treat their patients all the same, regardless of their needs.\n\n“Let's say you're 75 years old and you have a ton of cool morbidities and you're just not feeling good ... Your doctor will be paid the exact same amount of money to see you ... as he or she will be paid to go and see a 16-year-old girl coming in for a UTI and just needs like five minutes and some antibiotics.”\n\nThat economic structure, he said, discourages coordination, conversation and long-term planning. “They have every incentive to keep you as sick as possible for as long as possible, because they've developed chronic treatments for all those things,” Hoskinson claimed.\n\nAnd what's the source that built his scathing claims about the health-care system? \"Because my dad's a doctor, my brother's a doctor. Grandfather was a doctor, uncle's a doctor,\" said Hoskinson\n\nTo fix this, Hoskinson suggests building a facility centered around the patient, not billing codes or bureaucracies and using cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain.\n\n\"Let's build a clinic where we put the patient at the center. We build care teams, we use AI and we do everything in our power to try to just make it patient-centered care that's affordable.\"\n\nAI, for this new system, will be used to support — not replace — the physicians. “Every day it can rag in the totality of all medical knowledge, and you can have agents representing each specialty of medicine... and give an updated care plan at the beginning of the day to the provider.”\n\nThe system, he said, can catch “subtle cues in the patient history” and help with real-time auditing. He also described plans for AI tools that can flag drug-to-drug interactions, transcribe patient visits and eventually act as an \"AI companion\" to help people interpret food labels, medications and supplements.\n\nThe project’s architecture may also involve blockchain.\n\nHoskinson referenced selective disclosure and zero-knowledge technology — cryptographic tools that can verify facts (like age or citizenship) without exposing underlying personal details. “You can satisfy the intent and philosophy of those buckets without revealing the underlying customer,” he said.\n\nHe also plans to open-source the entire model — including protocols and software — to allow replication elsewhere. “We’re not here to make money off of [it],” Hoskinson said. “The goal is to open source them, open source the software, you know, get that care system out there.”\n\nHe’s also pushing for a broader policy reset. “Health insurance should be the same way you buy it in case you get really fucking sick,” Hoskinson said. “It makes no sense to say, well, it's there for when you get a paper cut or there for when you want to get birth control or something.”\n\nHowever, Hoskinson claims that this new model of health care is facing pushback from the traditional medical system.\n\n\"The hospital there is trying to kill us,\" he alleges.\n\n\"They do everything in their power to make our life miserable. Uh, they won't credential our doctors. So it takes six months to 12 months to get credentials to have them practice medicine. I bring a world famous surgeon and a famous transplant surgeon. They won't give 'em credentials,\" Hoskinson said.\n\nWhile Hoskinson's fight to revamp the health-care system might be a David versus Goliath scenario, he sees this as part of his and his family's legacy. \"I put $200 million of my own money into my clinic and we've been building for the last three years, and I legitimately wanna solve this problem,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's my legacy and it's the family's legacy and it's also the single most important thing in America.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nShayne Coplan Becomes Youngest Self-Made Billionaire After Polymarket's $2B Investment: BBG\n\nShayne Coplan’s net worth reportedly passed $1 billion after the New York Stock Exchange's owner valued Polymarket at $8 billion.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Derivatives exchange Cboe said it plans to introduce “Continuous futures” for bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,457.34\nand ether\nETH\n$4,534.16\non Nov. 10, pending regulatory clearance. The products are designed to resemble perpetual futures contracts popular on offshore exchanges, but with modifications to fit U.S. regulatory structures.\n\nUnlike traditional futures, which expire monthly or quarterly, Cboe’s new contracts will last up to 10 years. That long horizon reduces the need for traders to continually “roll” their positions into new contracts, a costly and time-consuming process. Instead, the futures will be adjusted daily against spot prices through a transparent funding rate mechanism.\n\nIn practice, that means a trader seeking to maintain long-term exposure to bitcoin could buy a Continuous futures contract and hold it for years without rebalancing. At the same time, the contracts are cash-settled, so no bitcoin or ether ever changes hands — settlement is in dollars, with payouts tied to crypto’s spot price.\n\n“Perpetual-style futures have gained strong adoption in offshore markets,” said Catherine Clay, Cboe’s head of derivatives. “We expect Continuous futures to appeal to not only institutional market participants and existing CFE customers, but also to a growing segment of retail traders seeking access to crypto derivatives.”\n\nCboe’s futures will clear through Cboe Clear U.S., a derivatives clearinghouse overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the company said.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency PEPE rose more than 4% over the last 24 hours to trade up nearly 10% over the past week.\n\nThe surge comes amid renewed interest in meme tokens, with the CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME) rising more than 11% over the past week, outperforming bitcoin’s 1.4% move. Over 24 hours, the memecoin sector is up 2.5%, compared with BTC’s 0.2%.\n\nPEPE rallied from $0.00001013 to $0.00001074, setting a new short-term resistance near $0.00001082, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. Trading activity spiked significantly, with over 5.89 trillion PEPE tokens changing hands during the peak of the rally, more than double the 24-hour average.\n\nThe price action shows a steady pattern of higher lows, a signal that buyers are stepping in consistently at increasingly elevated levels. That sort of structure is often interpreted as a sign of accumulation by more engaged investors.\n\nDuring the most active phase of the move, the token also touched $0.00001081 before settling slightly lower. That quick spike drew a new resistance line while a firm support level emerged around $0.00001017.\n\nThese price boundaries, tested multiple times, help shape traders' expectations about where the coin might go next.\n\nThe rally was marked by strong liquidity and sustained demand. Activity surged around several retests of the $0.00001069 mark, a level that held each time, reinforcing its strength.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

    "content": "U.S.-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) is creating a new ecosystem that combines stablecoin-based micropayments with AI.\n\nBuilding on the release earlier this year of x402, an open source payment protocol that enables instant stablecoin payments on any website, Coinbase engineers have added a discovery layer for AI agents, something like a “Google for agents,” that the firm is calling x402 Bazaar.\n\nThis matters because it’s about unlocking new paradigms within agentic commerce, a term often associated with humans setting out requirements and preferences for AI agents to shop for them.\n\nIn fact, the marketplace of things AI agents are going to want to buy is actually significantly bigger than the things that humans may want to buy, says Erik Reppel, head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform. He used the term “pay-per-crawl” to describe the problem being solved.\n\n“Think of it as like paywalls for scrapers,” Reppel said in an interview. “ So x402 is a great standard for situations where an AI agent needs access to data or access to content in order to make more informed, better decisions.”\n\nImagine an agent pulling the latest market data, commissioning a design from an AI art model, or subscribing to a live data feed for sports or finance, Coinbase said in a blog about x402 Bizarre.\n\nSome of the first projects listed include Prixe, a stock price API allowing agents to create up-to-date financial reports, and various image and video generation endpoints.\n\nAs more services are added, the possibilities for autonomous workflows will only expand, Reppel said.\n\n“Really any digital goods or any digital piece of media can be paid for with X 402,” he said.\n\nMore For You\n\nShayne Coplan Becomes Youngest Self-Made Billionaire After Polymarket's $2B Investment: BBG\n\nShayne Coplan’s net worth reportedly passed $1 billion after the New York Stock Exchange's owner valued Polymarket at $8 billion.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It's worth noting that more than 80% of MYX's supply is currently locked, with just 197 million tokens circulating, which means the assets could be prone to manipulation with such a constricted supply as several traders pointed out on X.\n\nMYX's rapid emergence has seen it become the 36th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nMore For You\n\nShayne Coplan Becomes Youngest Self-Made Billionaire After Polymarket's $2B Investment: BBG\n\nShayne Coplan’s net worth reportedly passed $1 billion after the New York Stock Exchange's owner valued Polymarket at $8 billion.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The reversal accelerated, beginning with consolidation near $4.97 before a late push to $4.99 at 14:00 UTC. Selling pressure then overwhelmed the market, driving ICP down to $4.93 within minutes.\n\nAt the time of writing, ICP traded just below $4.90, 3% below its intraday high of $5.05.\n\nTurnover spiked sharply during this interval, with more than 170,000 units transacted between 14:01 and 14:03, suggesting systematic liquidations or stop-loss execution.\n\nBeyond technicals, ICP’s momentum reflects ongoing ecosystem development. On Sept. 4, the network achieved its Ignition milestone, enabling large language models (LLMs) to run natively on-chain.\n\nThe upgrade allows developers to build AI-powered decentralized applications (dapps), including those that can generate smart contracts directly, on the ICP blockchain.

Traders expect heightened volatility in the weeks ahead, with DOGE already trading up 17% in the past week on expectations of the forthcoming launch.\n\nJordan Jefferson, CEO of DogeOS and MyDoge, called the ETF a watershed in a note to CoinDesk.\n\n“Dogecoin started as a joke, and now Wall Street finally gets it. The ETF approval proves that institutional investors recognize the real value in community, culture, and accessibility,\" he said. \"When pension funds are buying the asset that started as a joke, you know we’ve reached a unique moment in financial history.\"\n\n\"Institutional capital flowing into DOGE provides new liquidity and stability while the Dogecoin ecosystem continues expanding with apps, games, and utility through DogeOS. The combination of Wall Street investment and grassroots community creates a foundation for sustained growth that few assets can match,\" Peterson added.\n\nThe DOGE ETF also comes as other memecoin products push for SEC approval. Canary Capital Group recently filed for a spot ETF tied to TRUMP Coin, a Solana-based token linked to President Donald Trump.\n\nA wave of 1933 Act filings remains pending with the agency, while $DOJE will slip through under the 40 Act structure already used by $SSK.\n\nMarket participants will watch closely to see whether inflows into DOGE ETFs expand the memecoin trade into regulated products, or whether liquidity remains concentrated on centralized exchanges.\n\nEither way, the listing is indicative of how cultural tokens are moving into mainstream financial wrappers — an institutionalization of memecoins few would have anticipated even a short time ago.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,385.02\nheld just under $112,000 on Monday as traders weighed the largest whale sell-off in more than two years against signs of long-term accumulation and resilient altcoin performance.\n\nOn-chain trackers at CryptoQuant have flagged over 100,000 BTC — worth approximately $12.7 billion — as exiting major wallets in the past 30 days. Analyst caueconomy called it “the largest coin distribution this year,” noting that whale reserves fell by 114,920 BTC, pushing spot prices briefly below $108,000 last week.\n\nThe scale mirrors July 2022, when whales last trimmed positions this aggressively.\n\n“The portfolios of major players are still shrinking, which may continue to pressure Bitcoin in the coming weeks,” the analyst said. The sales have coincided with softer ETF inflows and thinner volumes, leaving the market leaning on macro catalysts.\n\nThe longer-term picture is more constructive. Bitcoin is down only 13% from its mid-August all-time high, far shallower than historic pullbacks. CryptoQuant analyst Dave the Wave said the one-year moving average, which sat at $52,000 a year ago, has now risen to $94,000 and will likely break through $100,000 in October — indicative of a structural uptrend.\n\nRyan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, said supply metrics back that view: “Bitcoin’s illiquid supply has climbed to a record 14.3 million BTC, with more than 70% of coins in wallets with little spending history. Confidence in long-term value remains evident.”\n\nLee sees price stabilizing and regaining momentum in a $105,000–$118,000 range, supported by ETF flows and bullish MACD signals.\n\nEthereum traded around $4,307, with Lee projecting a $4,100–$4,600 band if ETF demand holds. He added that upcoming network upgrades and DeFi catalysts could drive independent gains.\n\nMeanwhile, market breadth showed modest improvement. XRP gained 2.3% to $2.96, Solana’s SOL rose 3.2% to $214, and dogecoin extended a 10.5% weekly climb to $0.236. Cardano’s ADA also strengthened, adding 6% over the past seven days to $0.865.\n\nStill, sentiment remains muted. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich noted that total crypto market capitalization rose 2.5% last week to $3.85 trillion but remains below its 50-day average.\n\n“This is a worrying indicator of underlying risk appetite,” he said in an email to CoinDesk. The sentiment index dipped into fear at 44 over the weekend before recovering to 51 on Monday, suggesting traders are in wait-and-see mode.\n\nSeptember’s seasonal weakness adds another layer of caution even as macro pressures continue to loom.\n\nJeff Mei, COO at BTSE, said in a Telegram message that U.S. inflation prints due midweek will steer the next move. “Higher-than-expected numbers would cause Bitcoin and Ethereum to decline, while lower numbers could cause a rally,” Mei said.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "Echoes of Summer 2023: Bitcoin’s Volatility Set to Surge",
    "content": "Just as a tense bow string pulled tightly releases energy in a sudden powerful snap, bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,384.04\nseems to be building energy for wild price swings in October, mirroring a pattern from 2023.\n\nThe crypto market has been boring lately, with bitcoin trading back and forth between $110,000 and $120,000. That has dented volatility expectations. For instance, Volmex FInance's BVIV index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility (IV), has dropped to an annualized 38%, reversing the brief spike to 41% in late August. The index appears on track to test the two-year low of 36% reached four weeks ago.\n\nImplied volatility represents the market’s expectation of future volatility. It is derived from option pricing and reflects the one standard deviation range of expected price movement of the underlying asset over the course of a year. Tracking at-the-money (ATM) IV over time provides a normalized view of market expectations, which tends to move in line with realized volatility and broader market sentiment.\n\nThe latest trend in the IV mirrors a setup from the summer of 2023, when IV fell sharply from around 50 to 35. In that period, IV stayed compressed until October and bitcoin bottomed out around $25,000 before rallying to about $46,000 by the end of year, just ahead of the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024.\n\nThe pattern was consistent with IV's mean-reverting nature. In other words, volatility tends to rise after a prolonged period of lull and peaks following a big move in either direction.\n\nThe latest volatility compression suggests the market is underpricing future price turbulence. If history is any guide, October could once again be the inflection point, where IV surges as bitcoin experiences a significant price move, possibly bullish. That's because, Historically, the fourth quarter has been bitcoin’s strongest quarter, delivering an average gain of around 85%.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The stock currently trades at a 0.87 multiple of net asset value (mNAV), according to SharpLink dashboard, limiting its ability to raise funds by selling shares for ETH purchases as part of its strategy.\n\nExecutives said that the firm has not tapped its at-the-market facility to sell shares while trading below net asset value, noting such moves would dilute ETH holdings per share, a key metric for the firm.\n\nDigital asset treasury firms plunged sharply over the past weeks as crypto markets cooled off.

    "title": "Ethereum, Solana Wallets Targeted in Massive 'npm' Attack But Just 5 Cents Taken",
    "content": "A phishing email on Monday took down one of Node.js’s most prolific developers by pushing malicious code into packages downloaded billions of times a week, in what researchers call the largest software supply-chain attack in recent times.\n\nWhile the scope of the attack is massive, Security Alliance said in a Tuesday report that the attacker walked away with barely a few cents. However, security teams now face the substantial cost of updating backend systems to counter further attacks.\n\nA very popular maintainer whose work (like chalk and debug-js) gets used in billions of downloads every week, known as “qix,” responsible for libraries such as chalk and debug-js, was compromised last week after receiving an email from support@npmjs[.]help. The domain once pointed to a Russian server and redirected to a spoofed two-factor authentication page hosted on the content delivery network BunnyCDN.\n\nThe credential stealer harvested username, password, and 2FA codes before sending them to a remote host. With full access, the attacker republished every qix package with a crypto-focused payload.\n\nNode Package Manager (shortened to npm, not NPM) is like an app store for developers and is where coders download little building blocks of code (called packages) instead of writing everything from scratch. A maintainer is the person or entity who creates and updates those packages.\n\nThe injected code was simple. It checked if window.ethereum was present and, if so, hooked into Ethereum’s core transaction functions. Calls to approve, permit, transfer, or transferFrom were silently rerouted to a single wallet, “0xFc4a4858bafef54D1b1d7697bfb5c52F4c166976.”\n\nAny Ethereum transaction with value and no data was also redirected. For Solana, the malware overwrote recipients with an invalid string beginning “1911…,” breaking transfers outright.\n\nNetwork requests were also intercepted.\n\nBy hijacking fetch and XMLHttpRequest, the malware scanned JSON responses for substrings resembling wallet addresses and replaced them with one of 280 hardcoded alternatives to look deceptively similar.\n\nBut for all the distribution, the impact was negligible.\n\nOn-chain data shows the attacker received only around five cents of ether and about $20 worth of an illiquid memecoin that traded less than $600 in volume, the Security Alliance report said.\n\nPopular browser wallet MetaMask also said on X that it was not affected by the npm supply chain attack as the wallet locks its code versions, uses manual and automated checks, and releases updates in stages. It also employs \"LavaMoat,\" which blocks malicious code even if inserted, and \"Blockaid,\" which rapidly flags compromised wallet addresses, to keep such attacks at bay.\n\nMeanwhile, Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet warned that the malicious code had been pushed into packages with over a billion downloads and was designed to silently replace wallet addresses in transactions.\n\nThe attack follows another case flagged last week by ReversingLabs, where npm packages used Ethereum smart contracts to conceal malware links — a technique that disguised command-and-control traffic as ordinary blockchain calls.\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it.\n\nBy Omkar Godbole (all times ET unless stated otherwise)\n\nDeFi coins are in the spotlight as bitcoin\nBTC\n$123,375.94\nand ether\nETH\n$4,527.75\nnotch modest gains ahead of Tuesday's big jobs revisions data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which are expected to reveal a much weaker job market in the year ended March 2025.\n\nUsually, weak jobs data means more Fed rate cuts — and that’s bullish for BTC. But there’s more to the story: BTC might be king, but it doesn’t yield anything. That’s where decentralized finance comes into the play, offering returns on idle coins through lending and borrowing protocols. This makes DeFi coins all the more attractive as rate-cut bets heat up.\n\nArthur Hayes, founder of Maelstrom, nailed it: “DeFi will get some of this cash searching for yield.” He pointed to Ethena’s sUSDe token, boasting a solid 7% yield, as a top beneficiary of the impending Fed rate cuts.\n\nSo, keep an eye out for DeFi, which is already showing signs of strength.\n\nThe CoinDesk DeFi Select Index (DFX) has jumped 3% in the past 24 hours, standing out as one of the top-performing crypto subsectors alongside the CoinDesk Memecoin and Metaverse Select Indices and the CoinDesk 80 Index. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index has gained a 1.6%.\n\nWithin DeFi, decentralized exchange tokens are stealing the show. HYPE surged 9% in 24 hours, pushing its seven-day gains to 22%. Even more eye-catching is lesser-known DEX MYX Finance’s native token, MYX, which exploded with a staggering 260% gain in just one day — yes, you read that right.\n\nAdding to the bullish signals, TradingView’s DeFi dominance index has climbed to 3.49%, the highest since early February, underscoring growing appetite for DeFi assets in the current market environment.\n\nOther sectors could gain as well. Most analysts expect retail investors to pull capital from money market funds and channel it into stocks and crypto alike as the Fed begins to cut rates.\n\nBut there's a catch. If the rate cut occurs alongside worsening economic conditions, then investors may retain money market investments, which are highly liquid and considered safe. So, keep an eye on the economic data, particularly the U.S. producer price index on Wednesday and the consumer price index on Thursday. Both could add to inflation concerns.\n\nThe political situation in Europe, particularly in France, and Japan and resulting bond market jitters could also destabilize markets.

    "title": "Stellar's XLM Token Gains 4% as Technical Indicators Signal Institutional Interest",
    "content": "Stellar’s XLM token saw a sharp rally during a 23-hour period between September 8 and 9, advancing 4% from $0.37 to $0.38 on heavy institutional flows. Trading volume surged to 90.25 million tokens at the September 9 breakout, more than double the 24-hour average, according to market data. A Wall Street proprietary trading desk highlighted the move, noting that resistance formed at $0.39 as corporate accounts began consolidating. Analysts described the $0.38–$0.39 range as a zone of institutional accumulation, underscoring growing corporate treasury interest in blockchain-linked assets.\n\nThe breakout also set the stage for a low-volatility consolidation period. Between 10:57 and 11:56 on September 9, XLM maintained a tight trading band, opening and closing at $0.38. Market participants said this stability was crucial for corporate treasurers, who often seek predictable price ranges before approving allocations to digital assets. The technical setup, including emerging golden cross patterns flagged by analysis firms, has bolstered the token’s credibility among institutional investors.\n\nBeyond the market action, regulatory developments are shaping how corporate finance teams assess their blockchain strategies. Paxos, fresh off its November 2024 acquisition of Molecular Labs, filed to issue a USDH stablecoin on Stellar’s infrastructure aimed at Hyperliquid’s corporate clients. The move builds on Paxos’s $160 billion track record in stablecoin issuance and highlights the firm’s intent to position Stellar as a regulated payments network for enterprises.\n\nAt the policy level, the recently enacted GENIUS Act has drawn criticism from banking associations, who argue its provisions could open doors for exchanges to package stablecoins as investment products. Still, corporate legal departments see the framework as a step toward regulatory clarity. Combined with Stellar’s growing network and Paxos’s proposed USDH stablecoin, the developments could accelerate corporate adoption of blockchain-based cross-border payments.\n\nTechnical metrics\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

FDIT is the token representation of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYOXX), the on-chain share class of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), which seeks to provide yield to investors by holding U.S. Treasury bills. The asset manager first unveiled the facility in March in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe key investor in the offering is tokenization platform Ondo Finance, holding $202 million in FBIT as a reserve asset for its OUSG yield-generating token, Ondo's daily report shows. OUSG uses a range of tokenized money market funds including BUIDL by BlackRock and Securitize, Franklin Templeton's BENJI and WisdomTree's WTGXX to back the token's value.\n\nTokenization of government debt, a crucial collateral asset in global markets, is part of a broader push to bring financial instruments, or real-world assets (RWA), onto blockchain rails. Global banks and asset managers like Fidelity Investments explore tokenization to cut settlement times, increase transparency and keep markets open around the clock.\n\nThe market of tokenized U.S. Treasuries is growing rapidly, more than tripling in the last year to $7.5 billion, RWA.xyz data shows. BlackRock and tokenization specialist Securitize dominates the market with the $2.4 billion BUIDL token, followed by offerings by Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree.\n\nThese tokens are increasingly used as a key piece of infrastructure for yield-earning strategies and collateral in the crypto economy.\n\nRead more: Nasdaq Seeks Nod From U.S. SEC to Tokenize Stocks\n\nMore For You\n\nShayne Coplan Becomes Youngest Self-Made Billionaire After Polymarket's $2B Investment: BBG\n\nShayne Coplan’s net worth reportedly passed $1 billion after the New York Stock Exchange's owner valued Polymarket at $8 billion.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "content": "Governance token of decentralized finance protocol\nENA\n$0.5785\nsurged on Tuesday to its strongest since late January as the protocol has made a big step towards activate a fee switch that would share protocol revenues to token holders.\n\nThe token hit 87 cents in the early hours, advancing 8.3% over the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows. It's up over 20% in a week.\n\nThe latest surge occurred as Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume, said on early Tuesday it will introduce trading with USDe, Ethena's $13 billion yield-generating token, on its platform starting Wednesday.\n\nListing the token on top exchanges is a key requirement for Ethena to enable the fee switch mechanism, sharing protocol profits with ENA token holders. The protocol made $54 million in revenues last month and over $480 million since its launch in late 2023, Token Terminal data shows.\n\n\"With the Binance USDE listing ENA fee switch is going to get turned on. That unlocks $500m of buybacks,\" said Arthur Hayes, BitMEX co-founder and a prominent investor in Ethena.\n\nBesides the listing, there's been a lot going for Ethena recently.\n\nEthena's USDe token mushroomed to nearly $13 billion from $5.5 billion in-mid July as crypto investors chase yields.

USDe currently pays out 6.5% annualized yield for those who stake their tokens, higher than traditional money market funds and USDC, USDT lending rates on DeFi lender Aave.\n\nEthena is also taking part in the digital asset treasury fever that's captivating stock markets. StablecoinX and TLGY, two firms about to merge and get listed on Nasdaq, raised $530 million to accumulate ENA tokens as a public vehicle.\n\nThe protocol also participate in the booming stablecoin issuance business.

    "title": "Nasdaq to Invest $50M in Winklevoss Twins' Gemini Crypto Exchange",
    "content": "Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is preparing to go public with Nasdaq as its listing venue.\n\nAccording to a statement from Nasdaq, Gemini will provide its custody and staking services on a nonexclusive basis to Nasdaq clients, while Gemini’s institutional users will have access to Calypso’s collateral management capabilities across traditional and digital assets.\n\nGemini is aiming for a Nasdaq debut on Friday under the ticker GEMI, though the timeline could change depending on market conditions, the report added.\n\nThe Reuters report noted that the offering comes amid a rebound in U.S. equity capital markets, where strong first-day performances from companies like Figma have encouraged more private firms to test investor appetite. Crypto names have also been active in recent months, including Circle and Bullish, whose IPOs drew significant institutional demand.\n\nIf completed, Gemini’s flotation would make it the third publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, following Coinbase, which this year became the first crypto trading platform to join the S&P 500, and Bullish (CoinDesk's parent company).\n\nBeyond its U.S. listing plans, Gemini is also deepening its presence in Europe. In a Sept. 5 blog post, the company announced a suite of new products for more than 400 million investors across the European Union and European Economic Area.\n\nThe rollout includes staking services for ETH and SOL and the launch of Gemini Perpetuals, a regulated derivatives offering that allows customers to trade perpetual contracts with leverage of up to 100x and no fixed expiration dates. Both products are being offered under European regulatory frameworks: staking is overseen through Gemini’s newly established Malta entity under MiCA approval, while derivatives fall under MiFID II rules, which govern traditional financial markets.\n\nMark Jennings, Gemini’s CEO for Europe, said the company’s goal is to make staking and derivatives accessible through a secure, easy-to-use platform. Staking, he noted, allows investors to earn rewards by contributing crypto to blockchain validation pools, while perpetual contracts give professional traders more ways to manage risk or take directional bets on the market.\n\nGemini said its staking service supports flexible pools with no minimum deposits, daily accrual of rewards and yields of up to 6% APR for SOL. For perpetuals, the exchange emphasized that positions can be collateralized with assets already in spot accounts, denominated in USDC, and managed within the same interface as spot trading.\n\nThe company framed these moves as part of a broader strategy to make Europe a cornerstone of its business. Jennings said the introduction of MiCA gives the EU a chance to lead globally on crypto regulation, setting standards across all 30 jurisdictions and providing investors with greater confidence.\n\n“Europe continues to be a strategic focus for Gemini,” Jennings said in the blog post. “With MiCA, the region can set the global benchmark for clear, consistent crypto rules.”\n\nUpdated at 7:57 p.m. UTC:\n\nMade a few small changes to make the nature of the partnership between Nasdaq and Gemini more clear.\n\nA Nasdaq spokesperson provided the following statement via email:\n\n\"We continue to expand our capabilities to serve our institutional clients and the broader investor universe as the regulatory landscape around crypto assets evolves. To prepare for future developments while maintaining an open-ecosystem approach to market infrastructure, we will partner with Gemini on a non-exclusive basis as part of a broader strategy to offer multi-custodial and staking services for crypto assets.\n\n\"Additionally, we will work with Gemini as a distribution partner for Nasdaq Calypso, to serve firms seeking to benefit from its collateral management capabilities across traditional and digital assets. The investment and partnership structure we have employed with Gemini is consistent with those that we typically structure through Nasdaq Ventures.\"\n\nMore For You\n\nTotal Crypto Trading Volume Hits Yearly High of $9.72T\n\nCombined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n\nWhat to know:\n\nPantera Backs TransCrypts with $15M Seed Round to Expand Blockchain Identity Platform\n\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s credential verification system beyond employment into healthcare and education.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

    "title": "HBAR Rallies 4.4% as Bulls Break Key Resistance",
    "content": "HBAR staged an impressive rally over the past day, climbing 4.4% as strong institutional flows propelled the token past a key resistance level. The move, which carried prices from $0.22 to $0.23 between September 8 and 9, was supported by a surge in trading activity. Volumes spiked to 91.65 million during the 13:00 hour — more than double the daily average of 40.85 million — reinforcing the view that large-scale buyers were behind the breakout.\n\nThe technical picture added weight to the bullish narrative. HBAR notched higher lows at $0.2217 and $0.2246 before shattering resistance at $0.2280 on massive volume. Momentum accelerated in the morning session, driving prices from $0.2274 to an intraday peak of $0.2335. Market structure and activity confirmed institutional accumulation, granting the breakout added credibility. Bulls appeared firmly in control as the rally unfolded.\n\nYet the strength proved fleeting. In the final hour of trading, HBAR reversed course, slipping 0.32% from $0.233 to $0.233 as profit-taking emerged. The selloff began after the token touched a session high of $0.234 at 09:20 and intensified during a concentrated window between 09:40 and 09:53. Heavy bursts of selling, with volumes of 1.97 million and 2.28 million tokens, signaled that institutional investors were cashing in on short-term gains.\n\nThe sharp pullback highlights the ongoing tug-of-war between bullish momentum and profit-taking pressures. While the breakout above resistance suggests broader appetite for HBAR, the swift reversal underscores the challenges in sustaining rallies in a market still sensitive to institutional flows. Bulls now face a test of conviction, with resistance near $0.234 emerging as a pivotal battleground.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
